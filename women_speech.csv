1976 Democratic National Convention Keynote Address,Barbara Charline Jordan,1976,"Thank you ladies and gentlemen for a very warm reception. It was one hundred and forty-four years ago that members of the Democratic Partyfirst met in convention to select a Presidential candidate. Since thattime, Democrats have continued to convene once every four years anddraft a party platform and nominate a Presidential candidate. And our meetingthis week is a continuation of that tradition. But there is something differentabout tonight. There is something special about tonight. What is different?What is special? I, Barbara Jordan, am a keynote speaker. When -- A lot of years passed since 1832, and during that time it would havebeen most unusual for any national political party to ask a BarbaraJordan to deliver a keynote address. But tonight, here I am. And I feel -- I feel thatnotwithstanding the past that my presence here is one additional bit ofevidence that the American Dream need not forever be deferred. Now -- Now that I have this grand distinction, what in the world am I supposedto say? I could easily spend this time praising the accomplishments ofthis party and attacking the Republicans -- but I don't choose to do that.I could list the many problems which Americans have. I could list the problemswhich cause people to feel cynical, angry, frustrated: problems which includelack of integrity in government; the feeling that the individual no longercounts; the reality of material and spiritual poverty; the feeling thatthe grand American experiment is failing or has failed. I could recitethese problems, and then I could sit down and offer no solutions. But Idon't choose to do that either. The citizens of America expect more. Theydeserve and they want more than a recital of problems. We are a people in a quandary about the present. We are a people insearch of our future. We are a people in search of a national community.We are a people trying not only to solve the problems of the present, unemployment,inflation, but we are attempting on a larger scale to fulfill the promiseof America. We are attempting to fulfill our national purpose, to create and sustain a society in which all of us are equal. Throughout -- Throughout our history, when people have looked for new ways to solve their problems and to uphold the principles of this nation, many times they have turned to political parties. They have often turned to the Democratic Party. What is it? What is it about the Democratic Party that makes it the instrument the people use when they search for ways to shape their future? Well I believe the answer to that question lies in our concept of governing. Our concept of governing is derived from our view of people. It is a concept deeply rooted in a set of beliefs firmly etched in the national conscience of all of us. Now what are these beliefs? First, we believe in equality for all andprivileges for none. This is a belief -- This is a belief that each American, regardless ofbackground, has equal standing in the public forum -- all of us. Because -- Because webelieve this idea so firmly, we are an inclusive rather than an exclusiveparty. Let everybody come. I think it no accident that most of those immigratingto America in the 19th century identified with the Democratic Party. Weare a heterogeneous party made up of Americans of diverse backgrounds.We believe that the people are the source of all governmental power; that the authority of the people is to be extended, not restricted. This -- This can be accomplished only by providing each citizen with every opportunity to participate in the management of the government. They must have that, we believe. We believe that the government which represents the authority of all the people, not just one interest group, but all the people, has an obligation to actively -- underscore actively -- seek to remove those obstacles which would block individual achievement -- obstacles emanating from race, sex, economic condition. The government must remove them, seek to remove them. We -- We are a party -- We are a party of innovation. We do not reject our traditions, but we are willing to adapt to changing circumstances, when change we must. We are willing to suffer the discomfort of change in order to achieve a better future. We have a positive vision of the future founded on the belief that the gap between the promise and reality of America can one day be finally closed. We believe that. This, my friends is the bedrock of our concept of governing. This isa part of the reason why Americans have turned to the Democratic Party.These are the foundations upon which a national community can be built. Let all understand that these guiding principles cannot be discardedfor short-term political gains. They represent what this country is allabout. They are indigenous to the American idea. And these are principleswhich are not negotiable. In other times -- In other times, I could stand here and give this kind of exposition on the beliefs of the Democratic Party and that would be enough. But today that is not enough. People want more. That is not sufficient reason for the majority of the people of this country to decide to vote Democratic.  We have made mistakes. We realize that. We admit our mistakes. In our haste to do all things for all people, we did not foresee the full consequences of our actions. And when the people raised their voices, we didn't hear. But our deafness was only a temporary condition, and not an irreversible condition. Even as I stand here and admit that we have made mistakes, I still believe that as the people of America sit in judgment on each party, they will recognize that our mistakes were mistakes of the heart. They'll recognize that. And now -- now we must look to the future. Let us heed the voice of the people and recognize their common sense. If we do not, we not only blaspheme our political heritage, we ignore the common ties that bind all Americans. Many fear the future. Many are distrustful of their leaders, and believe that their voices are never heard. Many seek only to satisfy their private work -- wants; to satisfy their private interests. But this is the great danger America faces -- that we will cease to be one nation and become instead a collection of interest groups: city against suburb, region against region, individual against individual; each seeking to satisfy private wants. If that happens, who then will speak for America? Who then will speak for the common good? This is the question which must be answered in 1976: Are we to be one people bound together by common spirit, sharing in acommon endeavor; or will we become a divided nation? For all of its uncertainty,we cannot flee the future. We must not become the ""New Puritans"" and rejectour society. We must address and master the future together. It can bedone if we restore the belief that we share a sense of national community,that we share a common national endeavor. It can be done. There is no executive order; there is no law that can require the Americanpeople to form a national community. This we must do as individuals, and if we do it as individuals, there is no President of the United States who can veto that decision. As a first step -- As a first step, we must restore our belief in ourselves. We are a generous people, so why can't we be generous with each other? We need to take to heart the words spoken by Thomas Jefferson: Let us restore the social intercourse -- ""Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony andthat affection without which liberty and even life are but drearythings."" A nation is formed by the willingness of each of us to share in theresponsibility for upholding the common good. A government is invigoratedwhen each one of us is willing to participate in shaping the future ofthis nation. In this election year, we must define the ""common good"" and beginagain to shape a  common future.Let each person do his or her part. If one citizen is unwilling to participate,all of us are going to suffer. For the American idea, though it is sharedby all of us, is realized in each one of us. And now, what are those of us who are elected public officials supposedto do? We call ourselves ""public servants"" but I'll tell you this: We aspublic servants must set an example for the rest of the nation. It is hypocriticalfor the public official to admonish and exhort the people to uphold thecommon good if we are derelict in upholding the common good. More is required -- More is required of public officials than slogans and handshakesand press releases. More is required. We must hold ourselves strictly accountable.We must provide the people with a vision of the future. If we promise as public officials, we must deliver. If -- If we as publicofficials propose, we must produce. If we say to the American people, ""Itis time for you to be sacrificial"" -- sacrifice. If the public official says that, we [public officials] must be the first to give. We must be. Andagain, if we make mistakes, we must be willing to admit them. We have todo that. What we have to do is strike a balance between the idea that government should do everything and the idea, the belief, that government ought to do nothing. Strike a balance. Let there be no illusions about the difficulty of forming this kindof a national community. It's tough, difficult, not easy. But a spiritof harmony will survive in America only if each of us remembers that weshare a common destiny; if each of us remembers, when self-interest and bitterness seem to prevail, that we share a common destiny. I have confidence that we can form this kind of national community. I have confidence that the Democratic Party can lead the way. I have that confidence. We cannot improve on the system of government handed down to us by thefounders of the Republic. There is no way to improve upon that. But whatwe can do is to find new ways to implement that system and realize ourdestiny. Now I began this speech by commenting to you on the uniqueness of aBarbara Jordan making a keynote address. Well I am going to close myspeech by quoting a Republican President and I ask you that as you listento these words of Abraham Lincoln, relate them to the concept of a nationalcommunity in which every last one of us participates: ""As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master."" This -- This -- ""This expresses my idea of Democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no Democracy."" Thank you.  "
Statement on House Judiciary Proceedings to Impeach President Richard Nixon,Barbara Charline Jordan,1974,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I join my colleague Mr. Rangel in thanking you for giving the junior members of this committee the glorious opportunity of sharing the pain of this inquiry. Mr. Chairman, you are a strong man, and it has not been easy but we have tried as best we can to give you as much assistance as possible. Earlier today, we heard the beginning of the Preamble to the Constitution of the United States: ""We, the people."" It's a very eloquent beginning. But when that document was completed on the seventeenth of September in 1787, I was not included in that ""We, the people."" I felt somehow for many years that George Washington and Alexander Hamilton just left me out by mistake. But through the process of amendment, interpretation, and court decision, I have finally been included in ""We, the people."" Today I am an inquisitor. An hyperbole would not be fictional and would not overstate the solemnness that I feel right now. My faith in the Constitution is whole; it is complete; it is total. And I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the destruction, of the Constitution. ""Who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as the representatives of the nation themselves?"" ""The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men."" And that's what we're talking about. In other words, [the jurisdiction comes] from the abuse or violation of some public trust. It is wrong, I suggest, it is a misreading of the Constitution for any member here to assert that for a member to vote for an article of impeachment means that that member must be convinced that the President should be removed from office. The Constitution doesn't say that. The powers relating to impeachment are an essential check in the hands of the body of the Legislature against and upon the encroachments of the Executive. The division between the two branches of the Legislature, the House and the Senate, assigning to the one the right to accuse and to the other the right to judge, the Framers of this Constitution were very astute. They did not make the accusers and the judgers -- and the judges the same person. We know the nature of impeachment. We've been talking about it awhile now. It is chiefly designed for the President and his high ministers to somehow be called into account. It is designed to ""bridle"" the Executive if he engages in excesses. ""It is designed as a method of national inquest into the conduct of public men."" The Framers confided in the Congress the power if need be, to remove the President in order to strike a delicate balance between a President swollen with power and grown tyrannical, and preservation of the independence of the Executive. The nature of impeachment: a narrowly channeled exception to the separation-of-powers maxim.  The Federal Convention of 1787 said that. It limited impeachment to high crimes and misdemeanors and discounted and opposed the term ""maladministration."" ""It is to be used only for great misdemeanors,"" so it was said in the North Carolina ratification convention. And in the Virginia ratification convention: ""We do not trust our liberty to a particular branch. We need one branch to check the other."" ""No one need be afraid"" -- the North Carolina ratification convention -- ""No one need be afraid that officers who commit oppression will pass with immunity."" ""Prosecutions of impeachments will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community,"" said Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, number 65. ""We divide into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused."" I do not mean political parties in that sense. The drawing of political lines goes to the motivation behind impeachment; but impeachment must proceed within the confines of the constitutional term ""high crime[s] and misdemeanors."" Of the impeachment process, it was Woodrow Wilson who said that ""Nothing short of the grossest offenses against the plain law of the land will suffice to give them speed and effectiveness. Indignation so great as to overgrow party interest may secure a conviction; but nothing else can."" Common sense would be revolted if we engaged upon this process for petty reasons. Congress has a lot to do: Appropriations, Tax Reform, Health Insurance, Campaign Finance Reform, Housing, Environmental Protection, Energy Sufficiency, Mass Transportation. Pettiness cannot be allowed to stand in the face of such overwhelming problems. So today we are not being petty. We are trying to be big, because the task we have before us is a big one. This morning, in a discussion of the evidence, we were told that the evidence which purports to support the allegations of misuse of the CIA by the President is thin. We're told that that evidence is insufficient. What that recital of the evidence this morning did not include is what the President did know on June the 23rd, 1972. The President did know that it was Republican money, that it was money from the Committee for the Re-Election of the President, which was found in the possession of one of the burglars arrested on June the 17th. What the President did know on the 23rd of June was the prior activities of E. Howard Hunt, which included his participation in the break-in of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, which included Howard Hunt's participation in the Dita Beard ITT affair, which included Howard Hunt's fabrication of cables designed to discredit the Kennedy Administration. We were further cautioned today that perhaps these proceedings ought to be delayed because certainly there would be new evidence forthcoming from the President of the United States. There has not even been an obfuscated indication that this committee would receive any additional materials from the President. The committee subpoena is outstanding, and if the President wants to supply that material, the committee sits here. The fact is that on yesterday, the American people waited with great anxiety for eight hours, not knowing whether their President would obey an order of the Supreme Court of the United States. At this point, I would like to juxtapose a few of the impeachment criteria with some of the actions the President has engaged in. Impeachment criteria: James Madison, from the Virginia ratification convention. ""If the President be connected in any suspicious manner with any person and there be grounds to believe that he will shelter him, he may be impeached."" We have heard time and time again that the evidence reflects the payment to defendants money. The President had knowledge that these funds were being paid and these were funds collected for the 1972 presidential campaign. We know that the President met with Mr. Henry Petersen 27 times to discuss matters related to Watergate, and immediately thereafter met with the very persons who were implicated in the information Mr. Petersen was receiving. The words are: ""If the President is connected in any suspicious manner with any person and there be grounds to believe that he will shelter that person, he may be impeached."" Justice Story: ""Impeachment"" is attended -- ""is intended for occasional and extraordinary cases where a superior power acting for the whole people is put into operation to protect their rights and rescue their liberties from violations."" We know about the Huston plan. We know about the break-in of the psychiatrist's office. We know that there was absolute complete direction on September 3rd when the President indicated that a surreptitious entry had been made in Dr. Fielding's office, after having met with Mr. Ehrlichman and Mr. Young. ""Protect their rights."" ""Rescue their liberties from violation."" The Carolina ratification convention impeachment criteria: those are impeachable ""who behave amiss or betray their public trust."" Beginning shortly after the Watergate break-in and continuing to the present time, the President has engaged in a series of public statements and actions designed to thwart the lawful investigation by government prosecutors. Moreover, the President has made public announcements and assertions bearing on the Watergate case, which the evidence will show he knew to be false. These assertions, false assertions, impeachable, those who misbehave. Those who ""behave amiss or betray the public trust."" James Madison again at the Constitutional Convention: ""A President is impeachable if he attempts to subvert the Constitution."" The Constitution charges the President with the task of taking care that the laws be faithfully executed, and yet the President has counseled his aides to commit perjury, willfully disregard the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, conceal surreptitious entry, attempt to compromise a federal judge, while publicly displaying his cooperation with the processes of criminal justice. ""A President is impeachable if he attempts to subvert the Constitution."" If the impeachment provision in the Constitution of the United States will not reach the offenses charged here, then perhaps that 18th-century Constitution should be abandoned to a 20th-century paper shredder! Has the President committed offenses, and planned, and directed, and acquiesced in a course of conduct which the Constitution will not tolerate? That's the question. We know that. We know the question. We should now forthwith proceed to answer the question. It is reason, and not passion, which must guide our deliberations, guide our debate, and guide our decision. I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.  "
The Fundamental Principle of a Republic,Anna Howard Shaw,1915,"When I came into your hall tonight, I thought of the last time I was in your city. Twenty-one years ago I came here with Susan B. Anthony, and we came for exactly the same purpose as that for which we are here tonight. Boys have been born since that time and have become voters, and the women are still trying to persuade American men to believe in the fundamental principles of democracy, and I never quite feel as if it was a fair field to argue this question with men, because in doing it you have to assume that a man who professes to believe in a Republican form of government does not believe in a Republican form of government, for the only thing that woman's enfranchisement means at all is that a government which claims to be a Republic should be a Republic, and not an aristocracy. The difficulty with discussing this question with those who oppose us is that they make any number of arguments but none of them have anything to do with Woman's Suffrage; they always have something to do with something else, therefore the arguments which we have to make rarely ever have anything to do with the subject, because we have to answer our opponents who always escape the subject as far as possible in order to have any sort of reason in connection with what they say. Now one of two things is true: either a Republic is a desirable form of government, or else it is not. If it is, then we should have it, if it is not then we ought not to pretend that we have it. We ought at least be true to our ideals, and the men of New York have for the first time in their lives, the rare opportunity on the second day of next November, of making the state truly a part of the Republic. It is the greatest opportunity which has ever come to the men of the state. They have never had so serious a problem to solve before, they will never have a more serious problem to solve in any future of our nation's life, and the thing that disturbs me more than anything else in connection with it is that so few people realize what a profound problem they have to solve on November 2. It is not merely a trifling matter; it is not a little thing that does not concern the state, it is the most vital problem we could have, and any man who goes to the polls on the second day of next November without thoroughly informing himself in regard to this subject is unworthy to be a citizen of this state, and unfit to cast a ballot. If woman's suffrage is wrong, it is a great wrong; if it is right, it is a profound and fundamental principle, and we all know, if we know what a Republic is, that it is the fundamental principle upon which a Republic must rise. Let us see where we are as a people; how we act here and what we think we are. The difficulty with the men of this country is that they are so consistent in their inconsistency that they are not aware of having been inconsistent; because their consistency has been so continuous and their inconsistency so consecutive that it has never been broken, from the beginning of our Nation's life to the present time. If we trace our history back we will find that from the very dawn of our existence as a people, men have been imbued with a spirit and a vision more lofty than they have been able to live; they have been led by visions of the sublimest truth, both in regard to religion and in regard to government that ever inspired the souls of men from the time the Puritans left the old world to come to this country, led by the Divine ideal which is the sublimest and the supremest ideal in religious freedom which men have ever known, the theory that a man has a right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, without the intervention of any other man or any other group of men. And it was this theory, this vision of the right of the human soul which led men first to the shores of this country. Now, nobody can deny that they are sincere, honest, and earnest men. No one can deny that the Puritans were men of profound conviction, and yet these men who gave up everything in behalf of an ideal, hardly established their communities in this new country before they began to practice exactly the same sort of persecutions on other men which had been practiced upon them. They settled in their communities on the New England shores and when they formed their compacts by which they governed their local societies, they permitted no man to have a voice in the affairs unless he was a member of the church, and not a member of any church, but a member of the particular church which dominated the particular community in which he happened to be. In Massachusetts they drove the Baptists down to Rhode Island; in Connecticut they drove the Presbyterians over to New Jersey; they burned the Quakers in Massachusetts and ducked the witches, and no colony, either Catholic or Protestant allowed a Jew to have a voice. And so a man must worship God according to the conscience of the particular community in which he was located, and yet they called that religious freedom, they were not able to live the ideal of religious liberty, and from that time to this the men of this government have been following along the same line of inconsistency, while they too have been following a vision of equal grandeur and power. Never in the history of the world did it dawn upon the human mind as it dawned upon your ancestors, what it would mean for men to be free. They got the vision of a government in which the people would be the supreme power, and so inspired by this vision men wrote such documents as were went from the Massachusetts legislature, from the New York legislature and from the Pennsylvania group over to the Parliament of Great Britain, which rang with the profoundest measures of freedom and justice. They did not equivocate in a single word when they wrote the Declaration of Independence; no one can dream that these men had not got the sublimest ideal of democracy which had ever dawned upon the souls of men. But as soon as the war was over and our government was formed, instead of asking the question, who shall be the governing force in this great new Republic, when they brought those thirteen little territories together, they began to eliminate instead of include the men who should be the great governing forces, and they said, who shall have the voice in this great new Republic, and you would have supposed that such men as fought the Revolutionary War would have been able to answer that every man who has fought, everyone who has given up all he has and all he has been able to accumulate shall be free, it never entered their minds. These excellent ancestors of yours had not been away from the old world long enough to realize that man is of more value than his purse, so they said every man who has an estate in the government shall have a voice; and they said what shall that estate be? And they answered that a man who had property valued at two hundred and fifty dollars will be able to cast a vote, and so they sang ""The land of the free and the home of the brave."" And they wrote into their Constitution, ""All males who pay taxes on $250 shall cast a vote,"" and they called themselves a Republic, and we call ourselves a Republic, and they were not quite so much of a Republic that we should be called a Republic yet. We might call ourselves angels, but that wouldn't make us angels, you have got to be an angel before you are an angel, and you have got to be a Republic before you are a Republic. Now what did we do? Before the word ""male"" in the local compacts, they wrote the word ""Church-members""; and they wrote in the word ""taxpayer."" Then there arose a great Democrat, Thomas Jefferson, who looked down into the day when you and I are living and saw that the rapidly accumulated wealth in the hands of a few men would endanger the liberties of the people, and he knew what you and I know, that no power under heaven or among men is known in a Republic by which men can defend their liberties except by the power of the ballot, and so the Democratic party took another step in the evolution of the Republic out of a monarchy and they rubbed out the word ""taxpayer"" and wrote in the word ""white"", and then the Democrats thought the millennium had come, and they sang "" The land of the free and the home of the brave"" as lustily as the Republicans had sung it before them and spoke of the divine right of motherhood with the same thrill in their voices and at the same time they were selling mother's babies by the pound on the auction block-and mothers apart from their babies. Another arose who said a man is not a good citizen because he is white, he is a good citizen because he is a man, and the Republican party took out that progressive evolutionary eraser and rubbed out the word ""white"" from before the word ""male' and could not think of another word to put in there- they were all in, black and white, rich and poor, wise and otherwise, drunk and sober; not a man left out to be put in, and so the Republicans could not write anything before the word ""male"", and they had to let the little word, ""male"" stay alone by itself. And God said in the beginning, ""It is not good for man to stand alone."" That is why we are here tonight, and that is all that woman's suffrage means; just to repeat again and again that first declaration of the Divine, ""It is not good for man to stand alone,"" and so the women of this state are asking that the word ""male"" shall be stricken out of the Constitution altogether and that the Constitution stand as it ought to have stood in the beginning and as it must before this state is any part of a Republic. Every citizen possessing the necessary qualifications shall be entitled to cast one vote at every election, and have that vote counted. We are not asking as our Anti-Suffrage friends think we are, for any of awful things that we hear will happen if we are allowed to vote; we are simply asking that that government which professes to be a Republic shall be a Republic and not pretend to be what it is not. Now what is a Republic? Take your dictionary, encyclopedia lexicon or anything else you like and look up the definition and you will find that a Republic is a form of government in which the laws are enacted by representatives elected by the people. Now when did the people of New York ever elect their own representatives? Never in the world. The men of New York have, and I grant you that men are people, admirable people, as far as they go, but they only go half way. There is still another half of the people who have not elected representatives, and you never read a definition of a Republic in which half of the people elect representatives to govern the whole of the people. That is an aristocracy and that is just what we are. We have been many kinds of aristocracies. We have been a hierarchy of church members, than an oligarchy of sex. There are two old theories, which are dying today. Dying hard, but dying. One of them is dying on the plains of Flanders and the Mountains of Galicia and Austria, and that is the theory of the divine right of kings. The other is dying here in the state of New York and Massachusetts and New Jersey and Pennsylvania and that is the divine right of sex. Neither of them had a foundation in reason, or justice, or common sense. Now I want to make this proposition, and I believe every man will accept it. Of course he will if he is intelligent. Whenever a Republic prescribes the qualifications as applying equally to all the citizens of the Republic, when the Republic says in order to vote, a citizen must be twenty-one years of age, it applies to all alike, there is no discrimination against any race or sex. When the government says that a citizen must be a native-born citizen or a naturalized citizen that applies to all; we are either born or naturalized, somehow or other we are here. Whenever the government says that a citizen, in order to vote, must be a resident of a community a certain length of time, and of the state a certain length of time and of the nation a certain length of time, that applies to all equally. There is no discrimination. We might go further and we might say that in order to vote the citizen must be able to read his ballot. We have not gone that far yet. We have been very careful of male ignorance in these United States. I was much interested, as perhaps many of you, in reading the Congressional Record this last winter over the debate over the immigration bill, and when that illiteracy clause was introduced into the immigration bill, what fear there was in the souls of men for fear we would do injustice to some of the people who might want to come to our shores, and I was much and I was much interested in the language in which the President vetoed the bill, when he declared that by inserting the clause we would keep out of our shores a large body of very excellent people. I could not help wondering then how it happens that male ignorance is so much less ignorant than female ignorance. When I hear people say that if women were permitted to vote a large body of ignorant people would vote, and therefore because an ignorant woman would vote, no intelligent women should be allowed to vote, I wonder why we have made it so easy for male ignorance and so hard for female ignorance. When I was a girl, years ago, I lived in the back woods and there the number of votes cast at each election depended entirely upon the size of the ballot box. We had what was known as the old- tissue ballots and the man who got the most tissue in was the man elected. Now the best part of our community was very much disturbed by this method, and they did not know what to do in order to get a ballot both safe and secret; but they heard that over in Australia, where the women voted, they had a ballot which was both safe and secret, so we went over there and we got the Australian ballot and we brought it here. But when we got it over we found it was not adapted to this country, because in Australia they have to be able to read their ballot. Now the question was how could we adapt it to our conditions? Someone discovered that if you should put a symbol at the head of each column, like a rooster, or an eagle, or a hand holding a hammer, that if a man has intelligence to know the difference between a rooster and an eagle he will know which political party to vote for, and when the ballot was adapted it was a very beautiful ballot, it looked like a page from Life. Now almost any American could vote that ballot, or if she had not that intelligence to know the difference between an eagle and a rooster, we could take the eagle out and put in the hen. Now when we take so much pains to adapt the ballot to the male intelligence of the United States, we should be very humble when we talk about female ignorance. Now if we should take a vote and the men had to read their ballot in order to vote it, more women could vote than men. But when the government says not only that you must be twenty-one years of age, a resident of the community and native born or naturalized, those are qualifications, but when it says that an elector must be a male, that is not a qualification for citizenship; that is an insurmountable barrier between one half of the people and the other half of the citizens and their rights as citizens. No such nation can call itself a Republic. It is only an aristocracy. That barrier must be removed before the government can become a Republic, and that is exactly what we are asking right now, that the last step in the evolutionary process be taken on November 2d. and that this great state of New York shall become in fact as it is in theory, a part of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Men know the inconsistencies themselves; they realize it in one way while they do not realize it in another, because you never heard a man make a political speech when he did not speak of this country as a whole as though the thing existed which does not exist and that is that the people were equally free, because you hear them declare over and over again on the Fourth of July ""under God the people rule."" They know it is not true, but they say it with a great hurrah, and they repeat over and over again that clause from the Declaration of Independence. ""Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed,"" and they see how they can prevent half of us from giving our consent to anything, and then they give it to us on the Fourth of July in two languages, so if it is not true in one it will be in the other, ""vox populi, vox Dei."" ""The voice of the people is the voice of God,"" and the orator forgets that in the people's voice there is a soprano as well as a bass. If the voice of the people is the voice of God, how are we ever going to know what God's voice is when we are content to listen to a bass solo? Now if it is true that the voice of the people is the voice of God, we will never know what the Deity's voice in government is until the bass and soprano are mingled together, the result of which will be the divine harmony. Take any of the magnificent appeals for freedom, which men make, and rob them of their universal application and you take the very life and soul out of them. Where is the difficulty? Just in one thing and one thing only, that men are so sentimental. We used to believe that women were the sentimental sex, but they can not hold a tallow candle compared with the arc light of the men. Men are so sentimental in their attitude about women that they cannot reason about them. Now men are usually very fair to each other. I think the average man recognizes that he has no more right to anything at the hands of the government than has every other man. He has no right at all to anything to which every other man has not an equal right with himself. He says why have I a right to certain things in the government; why have I a right to life and liberty; why have I a right to this or this? Does he say because I am a man? Not at all, because I am human, and being human I have a right to everything which belongs to humanity, and every right which any other human being has, I have. And then he says of his neighbor, and my neighbor he also is human, therefore every right which belongs to me as a human being, belongs to him as a human being, and I have no right to anything under the government to which he is not equally entitled. And then up comes a woman, and then they say now she's a woman; she is not quite human, but she is my wife, or my sister, or my daughter, or an aunt, or my cousin. She is not quite human; she is only related to a human, and being related to a human a human will take care of her. So we have had that care-taking human being to look after us and they have not recognized that women too are equally human with men. Now if men could forget for a minute and believe the anti-suffragists say that we want men to forget that we are related to them, they don't know men, if for a minute they could forget our relationship and remember that we are equally human with themselves, then they would say, yes, and this human being, not because she is a woman, but because she is human is entitled to every privilege and every right under the government which I, as a human being am entitled to. The only reason men do not see as fairly in regard to women as they do in regard to each other is because they have looked upon us from an altogether different plane than what they have looked at men; that is because women have been the homemakers while men have been the so- called protectors, in the period of the world's civilization when people needed to be protected. I know that they say that men protect us now and when we ask them what they are protecting us from the only answer they can give is from themselves. I do not think that men need any very great credit for protecting us from themselves. They are not protecting us from any special thing from which we could not protect ourselves except themselves. Now this old time idea of protection was all right when the world needed this protection, but today the protection in civilization comes from within and not from without. What are the arguments, which our good Anti-friends give us? We know that lately they have stopped to argue and call suffragists all sorts of creatures. If there is anything we believe that we do not believe, we have not heard about them, so the cry goes out of this; the cry of the infant's mind; the cry of a little child. The anti-suffragists' cries are all the cries of little children who are afraid of the unborn and are forever crying, ""The goblins will catch you if you don't watch out."" So that anything that has not been should not be and all that is right, when as a matter of fact if the world believed that we would be in a static condition and never move, except back like a crab. And so the cry goes on. When suffragists are feminists, and when I ask what that is no one is able to tell me. I would give anything to know what a feminist is. They say, would you like to be a feminist? If I could find out I would, you either have to be masculine or feminine and I prefer feminine. Then they cry that we are socialists, and anarchists. Just how a human can be both at the same time, I really do not know. If I know what socialism means it means absolute government and anarchism means no government at all. So we are feminists, socialists, anarchists, and Mormons or spinsters. Now that is about the list. I have not heard the last speech. Now as a matter of fact, as a unit we are nothing, as individuals we are like all other individuals. We have our theories, our beliefs, but as suffragists we have but one belief, but one principle, but one theory and that is the right of a human being to have a voice in the government, under which he or she lives, on that we agree, if on nothing else. Whether we agree or not on religion or politics we are concerned. A clergyman asked me the other day, "" By the way, what church does your official board belong to?"" I said I don't know. He said, "" Don't you know what religion your official board believes?"" I said, ""Really it never occurred to me, but I will [missing text] them up and see, they are not elected to my board because they believe in any particular church. We had no concern either as to what we believe as religionists or as to what we believe as women in regard to theories of government, except that one fundamental theory in the right of democracy. We do not believe in this fad or the other, but whenever any question is to be settled in any community, then the people of that community shall settle that question, the women people equally with the men people. That is all there is to it, and yet when it comes to arguing our case they bring up all sorts of arguments, and the beauty of it is they always answer all their own arguments. They never make an argument, but they answer it. When I was asked to answer one of their debates I said, "" What is the use? Divide up their literature and let them destroy themselves."" I was followed up last year by a young, married woman from New Jersey. She left her husband home for three months to tell the women that their place was at home, and that they could not leave home long enough to go to the ballot box, and she brought all her arguments out in pairs and backed them up by statistics. The anti-suffragists can gather more statistics than any other person I ever saw, and there is nothing so sweet and calm as when they say, ""You cannot deny this, because here are the figures, and figures never lie."" Well they don't but some liars figure. When they start out they always begin the same. She started by proving that it was no use to give the women the ballot because if they did have it they would not use it, and she had statistics to prove it. If we would not use it then I really can not see the harm of giving it to us, we would not hurt anybody with it and what an easy way for you men to get rid of us. No more suffrage meetings, never any nagging you again, no one could blame you for anything that went wrong with the town, if it did not run right, all you would have to say is, you have the power, why don't you go ahead and clean up. Then the young lady, unfortunately for her first argument, proved by statistics, of which she had many, the awful results which happened where women did have the ballot; what awful laws have been brought about by women's vote; the conditions that prevail in the homes and how deeply women get interested in politics, because women are hysterical, and we can not think of anything else, we just forget our families, cease to care for our children, cease to love our husbands and just go to the polls and vote and keep on voting for ten hours a day 365 days in the year, never let up, if we ever get to the polls once you will never get us home, so that the women will not vote at all, and they will not do anything but vote. Now these are two very strong anti-suffrage arguments and they can prove them by figures. Then they will tell you that if women are permitted to vote it will be a great expense and no use because wives will vote just as their husbands do; even if we have no husbands, that would not effect the result because we would vote just as our husbands would vote if we had one. How I wish the anti-suffragists could make the men believe that; if they could make men believe that the women would vote just as they wanted them to do you think we would ever have to make another speech or hold another meeting, we would have to vote whether we wanted to or not. And then the very one who will tell you that women will vote just as their husbands do will tell you in five minutes that they will not vote as their husbands will and then the discord in the homes, and the divorce. Why, they have discovered that in Colorado there are more divorces than there were before women began to vote, but they have forgotten to tell you that there are four times as many people in Colorado today as there were when women began to vote, and that may have some effect, particularly as these people went from the East. Then they will tell you all the trouble that happens in the home. A gentleman told me that in California [missing text] and when he was talking I had a wonderful thing pass through my mind, because he said that he and his wife had lived together for twenty years and never had a difference in opinion in the whole twenty years and he was afraid if women began to vote that his wife would vote differently from him and then that beautiful harmony which they had had for twenty years would be broken, and all the time he was talking I could not help wondering which was the idiot because I knew that no intelligent human beings could live together for twenty years and not have a differences of opinion. All the time he was talking I looked at that splendid type of manhood and thought, how would a man feel being tagged up by a little woman for twenty years saying, ""Me too, me too."" I would not want to live in a house with a human being for twenty years who agreed with everything I said. The stagnation of a frog pond would be hilarious compared to that. What a reflection is that on men. If we should say that about men we would never hear the last of it. Now it may be that the kind of men being that the anti-suffragists live with is that kind, but they are not the kind we live with and we could not do it. Great big overgrown babies! Cannot be disputed without having a row! While we do not believe that men are saints, by any means, we do believe that the average American man is a fairly good sort of fellow. In fact my theory of the whole matter is exactly opposite, because instead of believing that men and women will quarrel, I think just the opposite thing will happen. I think just about six weeks before election a sort of honeymoon will start and it will continue until they will think they are again hanging over the gate, all in order to get each other's votes. When men want each other's votes they do not go up and knock them down; they are very solicitous of each other, if they are thirsty or need a smoke or [missing text] well we don't worry about home. The husband and wife who are quarreling after the vote are quarreling now. Then the other belief that the women would not vote if they had a vote and would not do anything else; and would vote just as their husbands vote, and would not vote like their husbands; that women have so many burdens that they cannot bear another burden, and that women are the leisure class. I remember having Reverend Dr. Abbott speak before the anti-suffrage meeting in Brooklyn and he stated that if women were permitted to vote we would not have so much time for charity and philanthropy, and I would like to say, ""Thank God, there will not be so much need of charity and philanthropy."" The end and aim of the suffrage is not to furnish an opportunity for excellent old ladies to be charitable. There are two words that we ought to be able to get along without, and they are charity and philanthropy. They are not needed in a Republic. If we put in the word ""opportunity"" instead, that is what Republics stand for. Our doctrine is not to extend the length of our bread lines or the size of our soup kitchens, what we need is for men to have the opportunity to buy their own bread and eat their own soup. We women have used up our lives and strength in fool charities, and we have made more paupers than we have ever helped by the folly of our charities and philanthropies; the unorganized methods by which we deal with the conditions of society, and instead of giving people charity we must learn to give them an opportunity to develop and make themselves capable of earning the bread; no human being has the right to live without toil; toil of some kind, and that old theory that we used to hear ""The world owes a man a living"" never was true and never will be true. This world does not owe anybody a living, what it does owe to every human being is the opportunity to earn a living. We have a right to the opportunity and then the right to the living thereafter. We want it. No woman, any more than a man, has the right to live an idle life in this world, we must learn to give back something for the space occupied and we must do our duty wherever duty calls, and the woman herself must decide where her duty calls, just as a man does. Now they tell us we should not vote because we have not the time, we are so burdened that we should not have any more burdens. Then, if that is so, I think we ought to allow the women to vote instead of the men, since we pay a man anywhere from a third to a half more than we do women it would be better to use up the cheap time of the women instead of the dear time of the men. And talking about time you would think it took about a week to vote. A dear, good friend of mine in Omaha said, ""Now Miss. Shaw,"" and she held up her child in her arms, ""is not this my job."" I said it certainly is, and then she said, ""How can I go to the polls and vote and neglect my baby?"" I said, ""Has your husband a job?"" and she said, ""Why you know he has."" I did know it; he was a banker and a very busy one. I said, ""Yet your husband said he was going to leave husband and go down to the polls and vote,"" and she said, ""Oh yes, he is so very interested in election."" Then I said, ""What an advantage you have over your husband, he has to leave his job and you can take your job with you and you do not need to neglect your job."" Is it not strange that the only time a woman might neglect her baby is on election day, and then the dear old Antis hold up their hands and say, ""You have neglected your baby."" A woman can belong to a whist club and go once a week and play whist, she cannot take her baby to the whist club, and she has to keep whist herself without trying to keep a baby whist. She can go to the theatre, to church or a picnic and no one is worrying about the baby, but to vote and everyone cries out about the neglect. You would think on Election Day that a woman grabbed up her baby and started out and just dropped it somewhere and paid no attention to it. It used to be asked when we had the question [missing text] box, ""Who will take care of the babies?"" I did not know what person could be got to take care of all the babies, so I thought I would go out West and find out. I went to Denver and I found that they took care of their babies just the same on election day as they did on every other day; they took their baby along with them, when they went to put a letter in a box they took their baby along and when they went to put their ballot in the box they took their baby along. If the mother had to stand in line and the baby got restless she would joggle the go-cart and when she went in to vote a neighbor would joggle the go-cart and if there was no neighbor there was the candidate and he would joggle the cart. That is one day in the year when you can get a hundred people to take care of any number of babies. I have never worried about the babies on Election Day since that time. Then the people will tell you that women are so burdened with their duties that they can not vote, and they will tell you that women are the leisure class and the men are worked to death: but the funniest argument of the lady who followed me about in the West: Out there they were great in the temperance question, and she declared that we were not prohibition, or she declared that we were. Now in North Dakota which is one of the first prohibition states, and they are dry because they want to be dry. In that state she wanted to prove to them that if women were allowed to vote they would vote North Dakota wet and she had her figures; that women had not voted San Francisco dry, or Portland dry, or Chicago dry. Of course we had not voted on the question in Chicago, but that did not matter. Then we went to Montana, which is wet. They have it wet there because they want it wet, so that any argument that she could bring to bear upon them to prove that we would make North Dakota wet and keep it wet would have given us the state, but that would not work, so she brought out the figures out of her pocket to prove to the men of Montana that if women were allowed to vote in Montana they would vote Montana dry. She proved that in two years in Illinois they had voted ninety-six towns dry, and that at that rate we would soon get over Montana and have it dry. Then I went to Nebraska and as soon as I reached there a reporter came and asked me the question, ""How are the women going to vote on the prohibition question?"" I said, ""I really don't know. I know how we will vote in North Dakota, we will vote wet in North Dakota; in Montana we will vote dry, but how we will vote in Nebraska, I don't know, but I will let you know just as soon as the lady from New Jersey comes."" We will either vote as our husbands vote or we will not vote as our husbands vote. We either have time to vote or we don't have time to vote. We will either not vote at all or we will vote all the time. It reminds me of the story of the old Irish woman who had twin boys and they were so much alike that the neighbors could not tell them apart, so one of the neighbors said, "" Now Mrs. Mahoney, you have two of the finest twin boys I ever saw in all my life, but how do you know them apart."" ""Oh,"" she says, ""That's easy enough any one could tell them apart. When I want to know which is which I just put my finger in Patsey's mouth and if he bites it is Mikey."" Now what does it matter whether the women will vote as their husbands do or will not vote; whether they have time or have not; or whether they will vote for prohibition or not. What has that to do with the fundamental question of democracy, no one has yet discovered. Bu they cannot argue on that; they cannot argue on the fundamental basis of our existence so that they have to get off on all of these side tricks to get anything approaching an argument. So they tell you that democracy is a form of government. It is not. It was before governments were; it will prevail when governments cease to be; it is more than a form of government; it is a great spiritual force emanating from the heart of the Infinite, transforming human character until some day, some day in the distant future, man by the power of the spirit of democracy, will be able to look back into the face of the Infinite and answer, as man can not answer today, "" One is our Father, even God, and all we people are the children of one family."" And when democracy has taken possession of human lives no man will ask from him to grant to his neighbor, whether that neighbor be a man or woman; no man will then be willing to allow another man to rise to power on his shoulders, nor will he be willing to rise to power on the shoulders of another prostrate human being. Bu that has not yet taken possession of us, but some day we will be free, and we are getting nearer and nearer to it all the time; and never in the history of our country had the men and women of this nation a better right to approach it than they have today; never in the history of the nation did it stand out so splendidly as it stands today, and never ought we men and women to be more grateful for anything than that there presides in the White House today a man of peace. As so our good friends go on with one thing after another and they say if women should vote they will have to sit on the jury and they ask whether we will like to see a woman sitting on a jury. I have seen some juries that ought to be sat on and I have seen some women that would be glad to sit on anything. When a woman stands up all day behind a counter, or when she stands all day doing a washing she is glad enough to sit; and when she stands for seventy-five cents she would like to sit for two dollars a day. But don't you think we need some women on juries in this country? You read your paper and you read that one day last week or the week before or the week before a little girl went out to school and never came back; another little girl was sent on an errand and never came back; another little girl was left in charge of a little sister and her mother went out to work and when she returned the little girl was not there, and you read it over and over again, and the horror of it strikes you. You read that in these United States five thousand young girls go out and never come back, don't you think that the men and women the vampires of our country who fatten and grow rich on the ignorance and innocence of children would rather face Satan himself than a jury of mothers. I would like to see some juries of mothers. I lived in the slums of Boston for three years and I know the need of juries of mothers. Then they tell us that if women were permitted to vote that they would take office, and you would suppose that we just took office in this country. There is a difference of getting an office in this country and in Europe. In England, a man stands for Parliament and in this country he runs for Congress, and so long as it is a question of running for office I don't think women have much chance, especially with our present hobbles. There are some women who want to hold office and I may as well own up. I am one of them. I have been wanting to hold office for more than thirty- five years. Thirty-five years ago I lived in the slums of Boston and ever since then I have wanted to hold office. I have applied to the major to be made an officer; I wanted to be the greatest office holder in the world, I wanted the position of the man I think is to be the most envied, as far as the ability to do good is concerned, and that is a policeman. I have always wanted to be a policeman and I have applied to be appointed policeman and the very first question that was asked me was, ""Could you knock a man down and take him to jail?"" That is some people's idea of the highest service that a policeman can render a community. Knock somebody down and take him to jail! My idea is not so much to arrest criminals as it is to prevent crime. That is what is needed in the police force of every community. When I lived for three years in the back alleys of Boston. I saw there that it was needed to prevent crime and from that day? This I believe there is no great public gathering of any sort whatever where we do not need women on the police force; we need them at every moving picture show, every dance house, every restaurant, every hotel, and every great store with a great bargain counter and every park and every resort where the vampires who fatten on the crimes and vices of men and women gather. We need women on the police force and we will have them there some day. If women vote, will they go to war? They are great on having us fight. They tell you that the government rests on force, but there are a great many kinds of force in this world, and never in the history of man were the words of the Scriptures proved to the extent that they are today, that the men of the nation that lives by the sword shall die by the sword. When I was speaking in North Dakota from an automobile with a great crowd and a great number of men gathered around a man who had been sitting in front of a store whittling a stick called out to another man and asked if women get the vote will they go over to Germany and fight the Germans? I said, ""Why no, why should we go over to Germany and fight Germans?"" ""If Germans come over here would you fight?"" I said, ""Why should we women fight men, but if Germany should send an army of women over here, then we would show you what we would do. We would go down and meet them and say, ""Come on, let's go up to the opera house and talk this matter over."" It might grow wearisome but it would not be death. Would it not be better if the heads of the governments in Europe had talked things over? What might have happened to the world if a dozen men had gotten together in Europe and settled the awful controversy, which is today discriminating the nations of Europe? We women got together there last year, over in Rome, the delegates from twenty-eight different nations of women, and for two weeks we discussed problems which had like interests to us all. They were all kinds of Protestants, both kinds of Catholics, Roman, and Greek, three were Jews and Mohamedans, but we were not there to discuss our different religious beliefs, but we were there to discuss the things that were of vital importance to us all, and at the end of the two weeks, after the discussions were over we passed a great number of resolutions. We discussed white slavery, the immigration laws, we discussed the spread of contagious and infectious diseases; we discussed various forms of education, and various forms of juvenile criminals, every question which every nation has to meet, and at the end of two weeks we passed many resolutions, but two of them were passed unanimously. One was presented by myself as Chairman on the Committee on Suffrage and on that resolution we called upon all civilizations of the world to give to women equal rights with men and there was not a dissenting vote. The other resolution was on peace. We believed then and many of us believe today, notwithstanding all the discussion that is going on, we believe and we will continue to believe that preparedness for war is an incentive to war, and the only hope of permanent peace is the systematic and scientific disarmament of all the nations of the world, and we passed a resolution and passed it unanimously to that effect. A few days afterward I attended a large reception given by the American ambassador, and there was an Italian diplomat there and he spoke rather superciliously and said, "" You women think you have been having a very remarkable convention, and I understand that a resolution on peace was offered by the Germans, the French women seconded it, and the British presiding presented it and it was carried unanimously."" We none of us dreamed what was taking place at that time, but he knew and we learned it before we arrived home, that awful, awful thing that was about to sweep over the nations of the world. The American ambassador replied to the Italian diplomat and said, ""Yes Prince, it was a remarkable convention, and it is a remarkable thing that the only people who can get together internationally and discuss their various problems without acrimony and without a sword at their side are the women of the world, but we men, even when we go to the Hague to discuss peace, we go with a sword dangling at our side."" It is remarkable that even at this age men can not discuss international problems and discuss them in peace. When I turned away from that place up in North Dakota that man in the crowd called out again, just as we were leaving, and said, ""Well what does a woman know about war anyway?"" I had read my paper that morning and I knew what the awful headline was, and I saw a gentleman standing in the crowd with a paper in his pocket, and I said, ""Will that gentleman hold the paper up."" And he held it up, and the headline read, ""250,000 Men Killed Since the War Began"". I said, ""You ask me what a woman knows about war? No woman can read that line and comprehend the awful horror; no woman knows the significance of 250,000 dead men, but you tell me that one man lay dead and I might be able to tell you something of its awful meaning to one woman. I would know that years before a woman whose heart beat in unison with her love and her desire for motherhood walked day by day with her face to an open grave, with courage, which no man has ever surpassed, and if she did not fill that grave, if she lived, and if there was laid in her arms a tiny little bit of helpless humanity, I would know that there went out from her soul such a cry of thankfulness as none save a mother could know. And then I would know, what men have not yet learned that women are human; that they have human hopes and human passions, aspirations and desires as men have, and I would know that that mother had laid aside all those hopes and aspirations for herself, laid them aside for her boy, and if after years had passed by she forgot her nights of sleeplessness and her days of fatiguing toil in her care of her growing boy, and when at last he became a man and she stood looking up into his eyes and beheld him, bone of her bone and flesh of her flesh, for out of her woman's life she had carved twenty beautiful years that went into the making of a man; and there he stands, the most wonderful thing in all the world; for in all the Universe of God there is nothing more sublimely wonderful than a strong limbed, clean hearted, keen brained, aggressive young man, standing as he does on the border line of life, ready to reach out and grapple with its problems. O, how wonderful he is, and he is hers. She gave her life for him, and in an hour this country calls him out and in an hour he lies dead; that wonderful, wonderful thing lies dead; and sitting by his side, that mother looking into the dark years to come knows that when her son died her life's hope died with him, and in the face of that wretched motherhood, what man dare ask what a woman knows of war. And that is not all. Read your papers, you can not read it because it is not printable; you cannot tell it because it is not speakable, you cannot even think it because it is not thinkable, the horrible crimes perpetrated against women by the blood drunken men of the war. You read your paper again and the second headlines read, ""It Costs Twenty Millions of Dollars a Day,"" for what? To buy the material to slaughter the splendid results of civilization of the centuries. Men whom it has taken centuries to build up and make into great scientific forces of brain, the flower of the manhood of the great nations of Europe, and we spend twenty millions of dollars a day to blot out all the results of civilization of hundreds and hundreds of years. And what do we do? We lay a mortgage on every unborn child for a hundred and more years to come. Mortgage his brain, his brawn, and every pulse of his heart in order to pay the debt, to buy the material to slaughter the men of our country. And that is not all, the greatest crime of war is the crime against the unborn. Read what they are doing. They are calling out every man, every young man, and every virile man from seventeen to forty-five or fifty years old; they are calling them out. All the splendid scientific force and energy of the splendid virile manhood are being called out to be food for the cannon, and they are leaving behind the degenerate, defective imbecile, the unfit, the criminals, the diseased to be the fathers of children yet to be born. The crime of crimes of the war is the crime against the unborn children, and in the face of the fact that women are driven out of the home shall men ask if women shall fight if they are permitted to vote. No, we women do not want the ballot in order that we may fight, but we do want the ballot in order that we may help men to keep from fighting, whether it is in the home or in the state, just as the home is not without the man, so the state is not without the woman, and you can no more build up homes without men than you can build up the state without women. We are needed everywhere where human problems are to be solved. Men and women must go through this world together from the cradle to the grave; it is God's way and the fundamental principle of a Republican form of government.  "
 United Nations 4th World Conference Speech Womens Rights are Human Rights,Hillary Rodham Clinton,1995,"Thank you very much, Gertrude Mongella, for your dedicated work that has brought us to this point, distinguished delegates, and guests: I would like to thank the Secretary General for inviting me to be part of this important United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women. This is truly a celebration, a celebration of the contributions women make in every aspect of life: in the home, on the job, in the community, as mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, learners, workers, citizens, and leaders. It is also a coming together, much the way women come together every day in every country. We come together in fields and factories, in village markets and supermarkets, in living rooms and board rooms. Whether it is while playing with our children in the park, or washing clothes in a river, or taking a break at the office water cooler, we come together and talk about our aspirations and concern. And time and again, our talk turns to our children and our families. However different we may appear, there is far more that unites us than divides us. We share a common future, and we are here to find common ground so that we may help bring new dignity and respect to women and girls all over the world, and in so doing bring new strength and stability to families as well. By gathering in Beijing, we are focusing world attention on issues that matter most in our lives -- the lives of women and their families: access to education, health care, jobs and credit, the chance to enjoy basic legal and human rights and to participate fully in the political life of our countries. There are some who question the reason for this conference. Let them listen to the voices of women in their homes, neighborhoods, and workplaces. There are some who wonder whether the lives of women and girls matter to economic and political progress around the globe. Let them look at the women gathered here and at Huairou -- the homemakers and nurses, the teachers and lawyers, the policymakers and women who run their own businesses. It is conferences like this that compel governments and peoples everywhere to listen, look, and face the worlds most pressing problems. Wasnt it after all -- after the womens conference in Nairobi ten years ago that the world focused for the first time on the crisis of domestic violence? Earlier today, I participated in a World Health Organization forum. In that forum, we talked about ways that government officials, NGOs, and individual citizens are working to address the health problems of women and girls. Tomorrow, I will attend a gathering of the United Nations Development Fund for Women. There, the discussion will focus on local -- and highly successful -- programs that give hard-working women access to credit so they can improve their own lives and the lives of their families. What we are learning around the world is that if women are healthy and educated, their families will flourish. If women are free from violence, their families will flourish. If women have a chance to work and earn as full and equal partners in society, their families will flourish. And when families flourish, communities and nations do as well. That is why every woman, every man, every child, every family, and every nation on this planet does have a stake in the discussion that takes place here. Over the past 25 years, I have worked persistently on issues relating to women, children, and families. Over the past two and a half years, I've had the opportunity to learn more about the challenges facing women in my own country and around the world. I have met new mothers in Indonesia, who come together regularly in their village to discuss nutrition, family planning, and baby care. I have met working parents in Denmark who talk about the comfort they feel in knowing that their children can be cared for in safe, and nurturing after-school centers. I have met women in South Africa who helped lead the struggle to end apartheid and are now helping to build a new democracy. I have met with the leading women of my own hemisphere who are working every day to promote literacy and better health care for  children in their countries. I have met women in India and Bangladesh who are taking out small loans to buy milk cows, or rickshaws, or thread in order to create a livelihood for themselves and their families. I have met the doctors and nurses in Belarus and Ukraine who are trying to keep children alive in the aftermath of Chernobyl. The great challenge of this conference is to give voice to women everywhere whose experiences go unnoticed, whose words go unheard. Women comprise more than half the worlds population, 70% of the worlds poor, and two-thirds of those who are not taught to read and write. We are the primary caretakers for most of the worlds children and elderly. Yet much of the work we do is not valued -- not by economists, not by historians, not by popular culture, not by government leaders. At this very moment, as we sit here, women around the world are giving birth, raising children, cooking meals, washing clothes, cleaning houses, planting crops, working on assembly lines, running companies, and running countries. Women also are dying from diseases that should have been prevented or treated. They are watching their children succumb to malnutrition caused by poverty and economic deprivation. They are being denied the right to go to school by their own fathers and brothers. They are being forced into prostitution, and they are being barred from the bank lending offices and banned from the ballot box. Those of us who have the opportunity to be here have the responsibility to speak for those who could not. As an American, I want to speak for those women in my own country, women who are raising children on the minimum wage, women who cant afford health care or child care, women whose lives are threatened by violence, including violence in their own homes. I want to speak up for mothers who are fighting for good schools, safe neighborhoods, clean air, and clean airwaves; for older women, some of them widows, who find that, after raising their families, their skills and life experiences are not valued in the marketplace; for women who are working all night as nurses, hotel clerks, or fast food chefs so that they can be at home during the day with their children; and for women everywhere who simply dont have time to do everything they are called upon to do each and every day. Speaking to you today, I speak for them, just as each of us speaks for women around the world who are denied the chance to go to school, or see a doctor, or own property, or have a say about the direction of their lives, simply because they are women. The truth is that most women around the world work both inside and outside the home, usually by necessity. We need to understand there is no one formula for how women should lead our lives. That is why we must respect the choices that each woman makes for herself and her family. Every woman deserves the chance to realize her own God-given potential. But we must recognize that women will never gain full dignity until their human rights are respected and protected. Our goals for this conference, to strengthen families and societies by empowering women to take greater control over their own destinies, cannot be fully achieved unless all governments -- here and around the world -- accept their responsibility to protect and promote internationally recognized human rights. The -- The international community has long acknowledged and recently reaffirmed at Vienna that both women and men are entitled to a range of protections and personal freedoms, from the right of personal security to the right to determine freely the number and spacing of the children they bear. No one -- No one should be forced to remain silent for fear of religious or political persecution, arrest, abuse, or torture. Tragically, women are most often the ones whose human rights are violated. Even now, in the late 20th century, the rape of women continues to be used as an instrument of armed conflict. Women and children make up a large majority of the worlds refugees. And when women are excluded from the political process, they become even more vulnerable to abuse. I believe that now, on the eve of a new millennium, it is time to break the silence. It is time for us to say here in Beijing, and for the world to hear, that it is no longer acceptable to discuss womens rights as separate from human rights. These abuses have continued because, for too long, the history of women has been a history of silence. Even today, there are those who are trying to silence our words. But the voices of this conference and of the women at Huairou must be heard loudly and clearly: It is a violation of human rights when babies are denied food, or drowned, or suffocated, or their spines broken, simply because they are born girls. It is a violation of human rights when women and girls are sold into the slavery of prostitution for human greed -- and the kinds of reasons that are used to justify this practice should no longer be tolerated. It is a violation of human rights when women are doused with gasoline, set on fire, and burned to death because their marriage dowries are deemed too small. It is a violation of human rights when individual women are raped in their own communities and when thousands of women are subjected to rape as a tactic or prize of war. It is a violation of human rights when a leading cause of death worldwide among women ages 14 to 44 is the violence they are subjected to in their own homes by their own relatives. It is a violation of human rights when young girls are brutalized by the painful and degrading practice of genital mutilation. It is a violation of human rights when women are denied the right to plan their own families, and that includes being forced to have abortions or being sterilized against their will. If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are womens rights and womens rights are human rights once and for all. Let us not forget that among those rights are the right to speak freely -- and the right to be heard. Women must enjoy the rights to participate fully in the social and political lives of their countries, if we want freedom and democracy to thrive and endure. It is indefensible that many women in nongovernmental organizations who wished to participate in this conference have not been able to attend -- or have been prohibited from fully taking part. Let me be clear. Freedom means the right of people to assemble, organize, and debate openly. It means respecting the views of those who may disagree with the views of their governments. It means not taking citizens away from their loved ones and jailing them, mistreating them, or denying them their freedom or dignity because of the peaceful expression of their ideas and opinions. In my country, we recently celebrated the 75th anniversary of Womens Suffrage. It took 150 years after the signing of ourDeclaration of Independence for women to win the right to vote. It took 72 years of organized struggle, before that happened, on the part of many courageous women and men. It was one of Americas most divisive philosophical wars. But it was a bloodless war. Suffrage was achieved without a shot being fired. But we have also been reminded, in V-J Day observances last weekend, of the good that comes when men and women join together to combat the forces of tyranny and to build a better world. We have seen peace prevail in most places for a half century. We have avoided another world war. But we have not solved older, deeply-rooted problems that continue to diminish the potential of half the worlds population. Now it is the time to act on behalf of women everywhere. If we take bold steps to better the lives of women, we will be taking bold steps to better the lives of children and families too. Families rely on mothers and wives for emotional support and care. Families rely on women for labor in the home. And increasingly, everywhere, families rely on women for income needed to raise healthy children and care for other relatives. As long as discrimination and inequities remain so commonplace everywhere in the world, as long as girls and women are valued less, fed less, fed last, overworked, underpaid, not schooled, subjected to violence in and outside their homes -- the potential of the human family to create a peaceful, prosperous world will not be realized. Let -- Let this conference be our -- and the worlds -- call to action. Let us heed that call so we can create a world in which every woman is treated with respect and dignity, every boy and girl is loved and cared for equally, and every family has the hope of a strong and stable future. That is the work before you. That is the work before all of us who have a vision of the world we want to see -- for our children and our grandchildren. The time is now. We must move beyond rhetoric. We must move beyond recognition of problems to working together, to have the comment efforts to build that common ground we hope to see. God's blessing on you, your work, and all who will benefit from it. Godspeed and thank you very much.  "
Democratic National Convention Keynote Address,Ann Richards,1988,"Thank you, very much. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Buenas noches, mis amigos. I'm delighted to be here with you this evening, because after listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to know what a real Texas accent sounds like. Twelve years ago Barbara Jordan, another Texas woman, Barbara made the keynote address to this convention, and two women in a hundred and sixty years is about par for the course. But if you give us a chance, we can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels. I want to announce to this Nation that in a little more than 100 days, the Reagan -Meese - Deaver - Nofziger - Poindexter - North - Weinberger - Watt - Gorsuch -Lavelle - Stockman - Haig - Bork - Noriega - George Bush [era] will be over! You know, tonight I feel a little like I did when I played basketball in the 8th grade. I thought I looked real cute in my uniform. And then I heard a boy yell from the bleachers, ""Make that basket, bird legs."" And my greatest fear is that same guy is somewhere out there in the audience tonight, and he's going to cut me down to size, because where I grew up there really wasnt much tolerance for self-importance, people who put on airs. I was born during the Depression in a little community just outside Waco, and I grew up listening to Franklin Roosevelt on the radio.  Well, it was back then that I came to understand the small truths and the hardships that bind neighbors together. Those were real people with real problems and they had real dreams about getting out of the Depression.  I can remember summer nights when wed put down what we called the Baptist pallet, and we listened to the grown-ups talk.  I can still hear the sound of the dominoes clicking on the marble slab my daddy had found for a tabletop.  I can still hear the laughter of the men telling jokes you werent supposed to hear -- talkin' about how big that old buck deer was, laughin' about mama puttin' Clorox in the well when the frog fell in. They talked about war and Washington and what this country needed. They talked straight talk. And it came from people who were living their lives as best they could. And thats what were gonna do tonight. Were gonna tell how the cow ate the cabbage. I got a letter last week from a young mother in Lorena, Texas, and I wanna read part of it to you. She writes, Our worries go from pay day to pay day, just like millions of others. And we have two fairly decent incomes, but I worry how Im going to pay the rising car insurance and food. I pray my kids dont have a growth spurt from August to December, so I dont have to buy new jeans. We buy clothes at the budget stores and we have them fray and fade and stretch in the first wash. We ponder and try to figure out how we're gonna pay for college and braces and tennis shoes. We dont take vacations and we don't go out to eat. Please dont think me ungrateful. We have jobs and a nice place to live, and were healthy. We're the people you see every day in the grocery stores, and we obey the laws. We pay our taxes. We fly our flags on holidays and we plod along trying to make it better for ourselves and our children and our parents. We arent vocal any more. I think maybe were too tired. I believe that people like us are forgotten in America. Well of course you believe you're forgotten, because you have been. This Republican Administration treats us as if we were pieces of a puzzle that cant fit together. They've tried to put us into compartments and separate us from each other. Their political theory is divide and conquer. Theyve suggested time and time again that what is of interest to one group of Americans is not of interest to any one else. Weve been isolated. Weve been lumped into that sad phraseology called special interests. Theyve told farmers that they were selfish, that they would drive up food prices if they asked the government to intervene on behalf of the family farm, and we watched farms go on the auction block while we bought food from foreign countries. Well, thats wrong! They told working mothers its all their fault -- their families are falling apart because they had to go to work to keep their kids in jeans and tennis shoes and college. And theyre wrong!! They told American labor they were trying to ruin free enterprise by asking for 60 days notice of plant closings, and thats wrong. And they told the auto industry and the steel industry and the timber industry and the oil industry, companies being threatened by foreign products flooding this country, that youre ""protectionist"" if you think the government should enforce our trade laws. And that is wrong. When they belittle us for demanding clean air and clean water for trying to save the oceans and the ozone layer, thats wrong. No wonder we feel isolated and confused. We want answers and their answer is that ""something is wrong with you.""  Well nothing's wrong with you. Nothings wrong with you that you cant fix in November! We've been told -- We've been told that the interests of the South and the Southwest are not the same interests as the North and the Northeast. They pit one group against the other. They've divided this country and in our isolation we think government isnt gonna help us, and we're alone in our feelings. We feel forgotten. Well, the fact is that we are not an isolated piece of their puzzle. We are one nation. We are the United States of America. Now we Democrats believe that America is still the county of fair play, that we can come out of a small town or a poor neighborhood and have the same chance as anyone else; and it doesnt matter whether we are black or Hispanic or disabled or a women [sic]. We believe that America is a country where small business owners must succeed, because they are the bedrock, backbone of our economy. We believe that our kids deserve good daycare and public schools. We believe our kids deserve public schools where students can learn and teachers can teach. And we wanna believe that our parents will have a good retirement and that we will too. We Democrats believe that social security is a pact that can not be broken. We wanna believe that we can live out our lives without the terrible fear that an illness is going to bankrupt us and our children.  We Democrats believe that America can overcome any problem, including the dreaded disease called AIDS.  We believe that America is still a country where there is more to life than just a constant struggle for money. And we believe that America must have leaders who show us that our struggles amount to something and contribute to something larger -- leaders who want us to be all that we can be. We want leaders like Jesse Jackson. Jesse Jackson is a leader and a teacher who can open our hearts and open our minds and stir our very souls. And he has taught us that we are as good as our capacity for caring, caring about the drug problem, caring about crime, caring about education, and caring about each other. Now, in contrast, the greatest nation of the free world has had a leader for eight straight years that has pretended that he can not hear our questions over the noise of the helicopters. And we know he doesnt wanna answer. But we have a lot of questions.  And when we get our questions asked, or there is a leak, or an investigation the only answer we get is, ""I dont know,"" or ""I forgot."" But you wouldnt accept that answer from your children. I wouldn't. ""Dont tell me you 'dont know' or you 'forgot.'"" We're not going to have the America that we want until we elect leaders who are gonna tell the truth; not most days but every day; leaders who dont forget what they dont want to remember. And for eight straight years George Bush hasn't displayed the slightest interest in anything we care about. And now that he's after a job that he cant get appointed to, he's like Columbus discovering America. He's found child care. He's found education. Poor George. He cant help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth. Well, no wonder. No wonder we cant figure it out. Because the leadership of this nation is telling us one thing on TV and doing something entirely different. They tell us -- They tell us that they're fighting a war against terrorists. And then we find out that the White House is selling arms to the Ayatollah. They -- They tell us that theyre fighting a war on drugs and then people come on TV and testify that the CIA and the DEA and the FBI knew they were flying drugs into America all along. And theyre negotiating with a dictator who is shoveling cocaine into this country like crazy. I guess thats their Central American strategy. Now they tell us that employment rates are great, and that theyre for equal opportunity. But we know it takes two paychecks to make ends meet today, when it used to take one. And the opportunity theyre so proud of is low-wage, dead-end jobs. And there is no major city in America where you cannot see homeless men sitting in parking lots holding signs that say, I will work for food. Now my friends, we really are at a crucial point in American history. Under this Administration we have devoted our resources into making this country a military colossus. But weve let our economic lines of defense fall into disrepair. The debt of this nation is greater than it has ever been in our history. We fought a world war on less debt than the Republicans have built up in the last eight years. You know, its kind of like that brother-in-law who drives a flashy new car, but hes always borrowing money from you to make the payments. Well, but lets take what they are most proudest of -- that is their stand of defense. We Democrats are committed to a strong America, and, quite frankly, when our leaders say to us, ""We need a new weapons system,"" our inclination is to say, Well, they must be right.  But when we pay billions for planes that wont fly, billions for tanks that wont fire, and billions for systems that wont work, ""that old dog wont hunt."" And you dont have to be from Waco to know that when the Pentagon makes crooks rich and doesnt make America strong, that its a bum deal. Now Im going to tell you, I'm really glad that our young people missed the Depression and missed the great Big War. But I do regret that they missed the leaders that I knew, leaders who told us when things were tough, and that wed have to sacrifice, and that these difficulties might last for a while. They didnt tell us things were hard for us because we were different, or isolated, or special interests. They brought us together and they gave us a sense of national purpose. They gave us Social Security and they told us they were setting up a system where we could pay our own money in, and when the time came for our retirement we could take the money out. People in the rural areas were told that we deserved to have electric lights, and they were gonna harness the energy that was necessary to give us electricity so my grandmamma didnt have to carry that old coal oil lamp around. And they told us that they were gonna guarant[ee] when we put our money in the bank, that the money was going to be there, and it was going to be insured. They did not lie to us. And I think one of the saving graces of Democrats is that we are candid. We talk straight talk. We tell people what we think. And that tradition and those values live today in Michael Dukakis from Massachusetts. Michael Dukakis knows that this country is on the edge of a great new era, that were not afraid of change, that were for thoughtful, truthful, strong leadership. Behind his calm theres an impatience to unify this country and to get on with the future. His instincts are deeply American. Theyre tough and theyre generous. And personally, I have to tell you that I have never met a man who had a more remarkable sense about what is really important in life. And then theres my friend and my teacher for many years, Senator Lloyd Bentsen. And I couldnt be prouder, both as a Texan and as a Democrat, because Lloyd Bentsen understands America. From the barrio to the boardroom, he knows how to bring us together, by regions, by economics, and by example. And hes already beaten George Bush once. So, when it comes right down to it, this election is a contest between those who are satisfied with what they have and those who know we can do better. Thats what this election is really all about. Its about the American dream -- those who want to keep it for the few and those who know it must be nurtured and passed along. Im a grandmother now. And I have one nearly perfect granddaughter named Lily. And when I hold that grandbaby, I feel the continuity of life that unites us, that binds generation to generation, that ties us with each other. And sometimes I spread that Baptist pallet out on the floor, and Lily and I roll a ball back and forth. And I think of all the families like mine, like the one in Lorena, Texas, like the ones that nurture children all across America. And as I look at Lily, I know that it is within families that we learn both the need to respect individual human dignity and to work together for our common good.  Within our families, within our nation, it is the same. And as I sit there, I wonder if shell ever grasp the changes Ive seen in my life -- if shell ever believe that there was a time when blacks could not drink from public water fountains, when Hispanic children were punished for speaking Spanish in the public schools, and women couldnt vote. I think of all the political fights Ive fought, and all the compromises Ive had to accept as part payment. And I think of all the small victories that have added up to national triumphs and all the things that would never have happened and all the people who wouldve been left behind if we had not reasoned and fought and won those battles together. And I will tell Lily that those triumphs were Democratic Party triumphs. I want so much to tell Lily how far weve come, you and I. And as the ball rolls back and forth, I want to tell her how very lucky she is that for all our difference, we are still the greatest nation on this good earth. And our strength lies in the men and women who go to work every day, who struggle to balance their family and their jobs, and who should never, ever be forgotten. I just hope that like her grandparents and her great-grandparents before that Lily goes on to raise her kids with the promise that echoes in homes all across America: that we can do better, and thats what this election is all about. Thank you very much.  "
 Declaration of Conscience,Margaret Chase Smith,1950,"r. President: I would like to speak briefly and simply about a serious national condition. It is a national feeling of fear and frustration that could result in national suicide and the end of everything that we Americans hold dear. It is a condition that comes from the lack of effective leadership in either the Legislative Branch or the Executive Branch of our Government. That leadership is so lacking that serious and responsible proposals are being made that national advisory commissions be appointed to provide such critically needed leadership. I speak as briefly as possible because too much harm has already been done with irresponsible words of bitterness and selfish political opportunism. I speak as briefly as possible because the issue is too great to be obscured by eloquence.  I speak simply and briefly in the hope that my words will be taken to heart. I speak as a Republican.  I speak as a woman.  I speak as a United States Senator.  I speak as an American. The United States Senate has long enjoyed worldwide respect as the greatest deliberative body in the world.  But recently that deliberative character has too often been debased to the level of a forum of hate and character assassination sheltered by the shield of congressional immunity. It is ironical that we Senators can in debate in the Senate directly or indirectly, by any form of words, impute to any American who is not a Senator any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming an American -- and without that non-Senator American having any legal redress against us -- yet if we say the same thing in the Senate about our colleagues we can be stopped on the grounds of being out of order. It is strange that we can verbally attack anyone else without restraint and with full protection and yet we hold ourselves above the same type of criticism here on the Senate Floor.  Surely the United States Senate is big enough to take self-criticism and self-appraisal.  Surely we should be able to take the same kind of character attacks that we ""dish out"" to outsiders. I think that it is high time for the United States Senate and its members to do some soul-searching -- for us to weigh our consciences -- on the manner in which we are performing our duty to the people of America -- on the manner in which we are using or abusing our individual powers and privileges. I think that it is high time that we remembered that we have sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution.  I think that it is high time that we remembered that the Constitution, as amended, speaks not only of the freedom of speech but also of trial by jury instead of trial by accusation. Whether it be a criminal prosecution in court or a character prosecution in the Senate, there is little practical distinction when the life of a person has been ruined. Those of us who shout the loudest about Americanism in making character assassinations are all too frequently those who, by our own words and acts, ignore some of the basic principles of Americanism: The right to criticize; The right to hold unpopular beliefs; The right to protest; The right of independent thought. The exercise of these rights should not cost one single American citizen his reputation or his right to a livelihood nor should he be in danger of losing his reputation or livelihood merely because he happens to know someone who holds unpopular beliefs.  Who of us doesnt?  Otherwise none of us could call our souls our own.  Otherwise thought control would have set in. The American people are sick and tired of being afraid to speak their minds lest they be politically smeared as ""Communists"" or ""Fascists"" by their opponents. Freedom of speech is not what it used to be in America. It has been so abused by some that it is not exercised by others. The American people are sick and tired of seeing innocent people smeared and guilty people whitewashed.  But there have been enough proved cases, such as the Amerasia case, the Hiss case, the Coplon case, the Gold case, to cause the nationwide distrust and strong suspicion that there may be something to the unproved, sensational accusations. As a Republican, I say to my colleagues on this side of the aisle that the Republican Party faces a challenge today that is not unlike the challenge that it faced back in Lincolns day. The Republican Party so successfully met that challenge that it emerged from the Civil War as the champion of a united nation -- in addition to being a Party that unrelentingly fought loose spending and loose programs. Today our country is being psychologically divided by the confusion and the suspicions that are bred in the United States Senate to spread like cancerous tentacles of ""know nothing, suspect everything"" attitudes.  Today we have a Democratic Administration that has developed a mania for loose spending and loose programs.  History is repeating itself -- and the Republican Party again has the opportunity to emerge as the champion of unity and prudence. The record of the present Democratic Administration has provided us with sufficient campaign issues without the necessity of resorting to political smears. America is rapidly losing its position as leader of the world simply because the Democratic Administration has pitifully failed to provide effective leadership. The Democratic Administration has completely confused the American people by its daily contradictory grave warnings and optimistic assurances -- that show the people that our Democratic Administration has no idea of where it is going. The Democratic Administration has greatly lost the confidence of the American people by its complacency to the threat of communism here at home and the leak of vital secrets to Russia though key officials of the Democratic Administration. There are enough proved cases to make this point without diluting our criticism with unproved charges. Surely these are sufficient reasons to make it clear to the American people that it is time for a change and that a Republican victory is necessary to the security of this country.  Surely it is clear that this nation will continue to suffer as long as it is governed by the present ineffective Democratic Administration. Yet to displace it with a Republican regime embracing a philosophy that lacks political integrity or intellectual honesty would prove equally disastrous to this nation. The nation sorely needs a Republican victory.  But I dont want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on the Four Horsemen of Calumny -- Fear, Ignorance, Bigotry, and Smear. I doubt if the Republican Party could -- simply because I dont believe the American people will uphold any political party that puts political exploitation above national interest.  Surely we Republicans arent that desperate for victory. I dont want to see the Republican Party win that way.  While it might be a fleeting victory for the Republican Party, it would be a more lasting defeat for the American people.  Surely it would ultimately be suicide for the Republican Party and the two-party system that has protected our American liberties from the dictatorship of a one party system. As members of the Minority Party, we do not have the primary authority to formulate the policy of our Government.  But we do have the responsibility of rendering constructive criticism, of clarifying issues, of allaying fears by acting as responsible citizens. As a woman, I wonder how the mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters feel about the way in which members of their families have been politically mangled in the Senate debate -- and I use the word ""debate"" advisedly. As a United States Senator, I am not proud of the way in which the Senate has been made a publicity platform for irresponsible sensationalism.  I am not proud of the reckless abandon in which unproved charges have been hurled from this side of the aisle.  I am not proud of the obviously staged, undignified countercharges that have been attempted in retaliation from the other side of the aisle. I dont like the way the Senate has been made a rendezvous for vilification, for selfish political gain at the sacrifice of individual reputations and national unity. I am not proud of the way we smear outsiders from the Floor of the Senate and hide behind the cloak of congressional immunity and still place ourselves beyond criticism on the Floor of the Senate. As an American, I am shocked at the way Republicans and Democrats alike are playing directly into the Communist design of ""confuse, divide, and conquer."" As an American, I dont want a Democratic Administration whitewash or ""cover-up"" any more than I want a Republican smear or witch hunt. As an American, I condemn a Republican ""Fascist"" just as much I condemn a Democratic ""Communist.""  I condemn a Democrat ""Fascist"" just as much as I condemn a Republican ""Communist.""  They are equally dangerous to you and me and to our country.  As an American, I want to see our nation recapture the strength and unity it once had when we fought the enemy instead of ourselves. It is with these thoughts that I have drafted what I call a ""Declaration of Conscience.""  I am gratified that Senator Tobey, Senator Aiken, Senator Morse, Senator Ives, Senator Thye, and Senator Hendrickson have concurred in that declaration and have authorized me to announce their concurrence. 1. We are Republicans. But we are Americans first. It is as Americans that we express our concern with the growing confusion that threatens the security and stability of our country. Democrats and Republicans alike have contributed to that confusion. 2. The Democratic administration has initially created the confusion by its lack of effective leadership, by its contradictory grave warnings and optimistic assurances, by its complacency to the threat of communism here at home, by its oversensitiveness to rightful criticism, by its petty bitterness against its critics. 3. Certain elements of the Republican Party have materially added to this confusion in the hopes of riding the Republican party to victory through the selfish political exploitation of fear, bigotry, ignorance, and intolerance. There are enough mistakes of the Democrats for Republicans to criticize constructively without resorting to political smears. 4. To this extent, Democrats and Republicans alike have unwittingly, but undeniably, played directly into the Communist design of confuse, divide and conquer. 5. It is high time that we stopped thinking politically as Republicans and Democrats about elections and started thinking patriotically as Americans about national security based on individual freedom. It is high time that we all stopped being tools and victims of totalitarian techniques -- techniques that, if continued here unchecked, will surely end what we have come to cherish as the American way of life.

 Wellesley College Commencement Speech,Barbara Pierce Bush,1990,"Thank you very, very much,President Keohane. Mrs. Gorbachev, Trustees, faculty, parents, and I should say, JuliaPorter, class president, and certainly my new best friend, Christine Bicknell -- and, ofcourse, the Class of 1990. I am really thrilled to be here today, and very excited, as Iknow all of you must be, that Mrs. Gorbachev could join us. These -- These are exciting times. They're exciting in Washington, and I havereally looked forward to coming to Wellesley. I thought it was going to be fun. I neverdreamt it would be this much fun. So, thank you for that. More than ten years ago, when I was invited here to talk about ourexperiences in the People's Republic of China, I was struck by both the natural beauty ofyour campus and the spirit of this place. Wellesley, you see, is not just a place but an idea -- an experimentin excellence in which diversity is not just tolerated, but is embraced. The essence ofthis spirit was captured in a moving speech about tolerance given last year by a studentbody president of one of your sister colleges. She related the story by Robert Fulghumabout a young pastor, finding himself in charge of some very energetic children, hits uponthe game called ""Giants, Wizards, and Dwarfs."" ""You have to decide now,""the pastor instructed the children, ""which you are -- a giant, a wizard, or adwarf?"" At that, a small girl tugging at his pants leg, asked, ""But where do themermaids stand?"" And the pastor tells her there are no mermaids. And she says,""Oh yes there are -- they are. I am a mermaid."" Now this little girl knew what she was, and she was not about togive up on either her identity, or the game. She intended to take her place wherevermermaids fit into the scheme of things. ""Where do the mermaids stand? All of those who aredifferent, those who do not fit the boxes and the pigeonholes?"" ""Answer thatquestion,"" wrote Fulghum, ""And you can build a school, a nation, or a wholeworld."" As that very wise young woman said, ""Diversity, like anything worthhaving, requires effort -- effort to learn about and respect difference, to be compassionatewith one another, to cherish our own identity, and to accept unconditionally the same inothers. You should all be very proud that this is the Wellesley spirit. NowI know your first choice today was Alice Walker -- guess how I know! -- known for TheColor Purple. Instead you got me -- known for the color of my hair. Alice Walker's bookhas a special resonance here. At Wellesley, each class is known by a special color. Forfour years the Class of '90 has worn the color purple. Today you meet on Severance Greento say goodbye to all of that, to begin a new and a very personal journey, to search foryour own true colors. In the world that awaits you, beyond the shores of Waban -- Lake Waban, noone can say what your true colors will be. But this I do know: You have a first classeducation from a first class school. And so you need not, probably cannot, live a""paint-by-numbers"" life. Decisions are not irrevocable. Choices do come back.And as you set off from Wellesley, I hope that many of you will consider making three veryspecial choices. The first is to believe in something larger than yourself, to getinvolved in some of the big ideas of our time. I chose literacy because I honestly believethat if more people could read, write, and comprehend, we would be that much closer tosolving so many of the problems that plague our nation and our society. And early on I made another choice, which I hope you'll make as well.Whether you are talking about education, career, or service, you're talking about life --and life really must have joy. It's supposed to be fun. One of the reasons I made the most important decision of mylife, to marry George Bush, is because he made me laugh. It's true, sometimes we'velaughed through our tears, but that shared laughter has been one of our strongest bonds.Find the joy in life, because as Ferris Bueller said on his day off, ""Life movespretty fast; and you don't stop and look around once in a while, you're going to miss it."" (I'm not going to tell George you clapped more for Ferris than youclapped for George.) The third choice that must not be missed is to cherish yourhuman connections: your relationships with family and friends. For several years, you'vehad impressed upon you the importance to your career of dedication and hard work. And, ofcourse, that's true. But as important as your obligations as a doctor, a lawyer, abusiness leader will be, you are a human being first. And those human connections --- withspouses, with children, with friends -- are the most important investments you will evermake. At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed onemore test, winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret timenot spent with a husband, a child, a friend, or a parent. We are in a transitional period right now -- We are in a transitional period right now, fascinating andexhilarating times, learning to adjust to changes and the choices we, men and women, arefacing. As an example, I remember what a friend said, on hearing her husband complain tohis buddies that he had to babysit. Quickly setting him straight, my friend toldher husband that when it's your own kids, it's not called babysitting. Now maybe we should adjust faster; maybe we should adjustslower. But whatever the era twenty -- whatever the era, whatever the times, one thing will never change:fathers and mothers, if you have children, they must come first. You must read toyour children, and you must hug your children, and you must love your children. Yoursuccess as a family, our success as a society, depends not on what happens in the WhiteHouse, but on what happens inside your house. For over fifty years, it was said that the winner of Wellesley'sannual hoop race would be the first to get married. Now they say, the winner will be thefirst to become a C.E.O. Both -- Both of those stereotypes show too little tolerance for those whowant to know where the mermaids stand. So -- So I want to offer a new legend: the winner of thehoop race will be the first to realize her dream -- not society's dreams  -- her ownpersonal dream. And who -- Who knows? Somewhere out in this audience may even be someonewho will one day follow in my footsteps, and preside over the White House as thePresident's spouse -- and I wish him well. Well, the controversy ends here. But our conversation is onlybeginning. And a worthwhile conversation it has been. So as you leave Wellesley today,take with you deep thanks for the courtesy and the honor you have shared with Mrs.Gorbachev and with me. Thank you. God bless you. And may your future be worthy of yourdreams.  "
 1992 Republican National Convention Address A Whisper of Aids,MaryFisher,1992,"Less than three months ago at platform hearings in Salt Lake City, I asked the Republican Party to lift the shroud of silence which has been drapedover the issue of HIV and AIDS.  I have come tonight to bring our silence to an end.  I bear a message of challenge, not self-congratulation.  I want your attention, not yourapplause. I would never have asked to be HIV positive, but I believe that in all things there is a purpose; and I stand before you and before the nation gladly.  The reality ofAIDS is brutally clear.  Two hundred thousand Americans are dead or dying.  A million more areinfected.  Worldwide, forty million, sixty million, or a hundred million infections will be counted in the coming few years.  But despite science and research, White Housemeetings, and congressional hearings, despite good intentions and bold initiatives, campaign slogans, and hopeful promises, it is-- despite it all -- the epidemic which iswinning tonight. In the context of an election year, I ask you, here in this great hall, or listening in the quiet of your home, to recognize that AIDS virus is not a politicalcreature.  It does not care whether you are Democrat or Republican; it does not ask whether you are black or white, male or female, gay or straight, young or old. Tonight, Irepresent an AIDS community whose members have been reluctantly drafted from every segment of American society. Though I am white and a mother, I am one with a black infant struggling with tubes in a Philadelphia hospital. Though I am female and contracted this disease in marriage and enjoy the warm support of my family, I am one with the lonely gay man sheltering a flickeringcandle from the cold wind of his familys rejection. This is not a distant threat.  It is a present danger.  The rate of infection is increasing fastest among women and children.  Largely unknown a decade ago, AIDS isthe third leading killer of young adult Americans today.  But it wont be third for long, because unlike other diseases, this one travels.  Adolescents dont give each othercancer or heart disease because they believe they are in love, but HIV is different; and we have helped it along. We have killed each other with our ignorance, our prejudice,and our silence. We may take refuge in our stereotypes, but we cannot hide there long, because HIV asks only one thing of those it attacks:  Are you human?  And this is the rightquestion.  Are you human?  Because people with HIV have not entered some alien state of being.  They are human.  They have not earned cruelty, and they do not deservemeanness.  They dont benefit from being isolated or treated as outcasts.  Each of them is exactly what God made: a person; not evil, deserving of our judgment; notvictims, longing for our pity -- people, ready for support and worthy of compassion. My call to you, my Party, is to take a public stand, no less compassionate than that of the President and Mrs. Bush.  They have embraced me and my family inmemorable ways.  In the place of judgment, they have shown affection.  In difficult moments, they have raised our spirits.  In the darkest hours, I have seen them reachingnot only to me, but also to my parents, armed with that stunning grief and special grace that comes only to parents who have themselves leaned too long over the bedsideof a dying child. With the Presidents leadership, much good has been done.  Much of the good has gone unheralded, and as the President has insisted, much remains to be done.But we do the Presidents cause no good if we praise the American family but ignore a virus thatdestroys it. We must be consistent if we are to be believed.  We cannot love justice and ignoreprejudice, love our children and fear to teach them.  Whatever our role as parentor policymaker, we must act as eloquently as we speak -- else we have no integrity.My call to the nation is a plea for awareness.  If you believe you are safe, you are in danger.Because I was not hemophiliac, I was not at risk.  Because I was not gay, I was not at risk.  Because I did not inject drugs, I was not at risk. My father has devoted much of his lifetime guarding against another holocaust.  He is part of the generation who heard Pastor Nemoellor come out of the Nazideath camps to say, They came after the Jews, and I was not a Jew, so, I did not protest.  They came after the trade unionists, and I was not a trade unionist, so, I did notprotest.  Then they came after the Roman Catholics, and I was not a Roman Catholic, so, I did not protest.  Then they came after me, and there was no one left toprotest. The -- The lesson history teaches is this:  If you believe you are safe, you are at risk.  If you do not see this killer stalking your children, look again.  There is no family orcommunity, no race or religion, no place left in America that is safe.  Until we genuinely embrace this message, we are a nation at risk. Tonight, HIV marches resolutely towardAIDS in more than a million American homes, littering its pathway with the bodies of the young -- young men, young women, young parents, and young children. One of the families is mine.  If it is true that HIV inevitably turns to AIDS, then my children will inevitably turn to orphans.My family has been a rock of support. My 84-year-old father, who has pursued the healing of the nations, will not accept the premise that he cannot heal hisdaughter.  My mother refuses to be broken.  She still calls at midnight to tell wonderful jokes that make me laugh.  Sisters and friends, and my brother Phillip, whosebirthday is today, all have helped carry me over the hardest places.  I am blessed, richly and deeply blessed, to have such a family. But not all of you -- But not all of you have been so blessed.  You are HIV positive, but dare not say it.  You have lost loved ones, but you dare not whisper the word AIDS. You weepsilently.  You grieve alone.  I have a message for you.  It is not you who should feel shame.  It is we -- we who tolerate ignorance and practice prejudice, we who have taughtyou to fear.  We must lift our shroud of silence, making it safe for you to reach out for compassion.  It is our task to seek safety for our children, not in quiet denial, but ineffective action. Someday our children will be grown.  My son Max, now four, will take the measure of hismother.  My son Zachary, now two, will sort through his memories.  I may not be here to hear their judgments, but I know already what I hope they are.  I want my children to know that their mother was not a victim.  She was a messenger.  I donot want them to think, as I once did, that courage is the absence of fear.  I want them to know that courage is the strength to act wisely when most we are afraid.  I wantthem to have the courage to step forward when called by their nation or their Party and give leadership, no matter what the personal cost. I ask no more of you than I askof myself or of my children.  To the millions of you who are grieving, who are frightened, who have suffered the ravages of AIDS firsthand: Have courage, and you will findsupport.  To the millions who are strong, I issue the plea: Set aside prejudice and politics to make room for compassion and soundpolicy. To my children, I make this pledge:  I will not give in, Zachary, because I draw my courage from you.  Your silly giggle gives me hope; your gentle prayers give mestrength; and you, my child, give me the reason to say to America, ""You are at risk.""  And I will not rest,Max, until I have done all I can to make your world safe.  I will seek a place where intimacy is not the prelude to suffering.  I will not hurry to leave you, my children, but when I go, I pray that you will not suffer shame on my account. To all within the sound of my voice, I appeal:  Learn with me the lessons of history and of grace, so my children will not be afraid to say the word ""AIDS"" when I am gone.Then, their children and yours may not need to whisper it at all. God bless the children, and Godbless us all. Good night. "
 The Struggle for Human Rights,Eleanor Roosevelt,1948,"I have come this evening to talk with you on one of the greatestissues of our time -- that is the preservation of human freedom. I have chosen to discussit here in France, at the Sorbonne, because here in this soil the roots of human freedomhave long ago struck deep and here they have been richly nourished. It was here theDeclaration of the Rights of Man was proclaimed, and the great slogans of the FrenchRevolution -- liberty, equality, fraternity -- fired the imagination of men. I have chosento discuss this issue in Europe because this has been the scene of the greatest historicbattles between freedom and tyranny. I have chosen to discuss it in the early days of theGeneral Assembly because the issue of human liberty is decisive for the settlement ofoutstanding political differences and for the future of the United Nations. The decisive importance of this issue was fully recognized by thefounders of the United Nations at San Francisco. Concern for the preservation andpromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms stands at the heart of the UnitedNations. Its Charter is distinguished by its preoccupation with the rights and welfare ofindividual men and women. The United Nations has made it clear that it intends to upholdhuman rights and to protect the dignity of the human personality. In the preamble to theCharter the keynote is set when it declares: ""We the people of the United Nationsdetermined...to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth ofthe human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small,and...to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.""This reflects the basic premise of the Charter that the peace and security of mankind aredependent on mutual respect for the rights and freedoms of all. One of the purposes of the United Nations is declared in article 1to be: ""to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of aneconomic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouragingrespect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as torace, sex, language, or religion."" This thought is repeated at several points and notably in articles55 and 56 the Members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in cooperationwith the United Nations for the promotion of ""universal respect for, and observanceof, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex,language, or religion."" The Human Rights Commission was given as its first and mostimportant task the preparation of an International Bill of Rights. The General Assembly,which opened its third session here in Paris a few days ago, will have before it the firstfruit of the Commission's labors in this task, that is the International Declaration ofHuman Rights. The Declaration was finally completed after much work during thelast session of the Human Rights Commission in New York in the spring of 1948. TheEconomic and Social Council has sent it without recommendation to the General Assembly,together with other documents transmitted by the Human Rights Commission. It was decided in our Commission that a Bill of Rights shouldcontain two parts: 1. A Declaration which could be approved through action of theMember States of the United Nations in the General Assembly. This declaration would havegreat moral force, and would say to the peoples of the world ""this is what we hopehuman rights may mean to all people in the years to come."" We have put down here therights that we consider basic for individual human beings the world over to have. Withoutthem, we feel that the full development of individual personality is impossible. 2. The second part of the bill, which the Human Rights Commissionhas not yet completed because of the lack of time, is a covenant which would be in theform of a treaty to be presented to the nations of the world. Each nation, as it isprepared to do so, would ratify this covenant and the covenant would then become bindingon the nations which adhere to it. Each nation ratifying would then be obligated to changeits laws wherever they did not conform to the points contained in the covenant. This covenant, of course, would have to be a simpler document. Itcould not state aspirations, which we feel to be permissible in the Declaration. It couldonly state rights which could be assured by law and it must contain methods ofimplementation, and no state ratifying the covenant could be allowed to disregard it. Themethods of implementation have not yet been agreed upon, nor have they been given adequateconsideration by the Commission at any of its meetings. There certainly should bediscussion on the entire question of this world Bill of Human Rights and there may beacceptance by this Assembly of the Declaration if they come to agreement on it. Theacceptance of the Declaration, I think, should encourage every nation in the coming monthsto discuss its meaning with its people so that they will be better prepared to accept thecovenant with a deeper understanding of the problems involved when that is presented, wehope, a year from now and, we hope, accepted. The Declaration has come from the Human Rights Commission withunanimous acceptance except for four abstentions -- the U.S.S.R., Yugoslavia, Ukraine, andByelorussia. The reason for this is a fundamental difference in the conception of humanrights as they exist in these states and in certain other Member States in the UnitedNations. In the discussion before the Assembly, I think it should be madecrystal clear what these differences are and tonight I want to spend a little time makingthem clear to you. It seems to me there is a valid reason for taking the time today tothink carefully and clearly on the subject of human rights, because in the acceptance andobservance of these rights lies the root, I believe, of our chance of peace in the future,and for the strengthening of the United Nations organization to the point where it canmaintain peace in the future. We must not be confused about what freedom is. Basic human rightsare simple and easily understood: freedom of speech and a free press; freedom of religionand worship; freedom of assembly and the right of petition; the right of men to be securein their homes and free from unreasonable search and seizure and from arbitrary arrest andpunishment. We must not be deluded by the efforts of the forces of reaction toprostitute the great words of our free tradition and thereby to confuse the struggle.Democracy, freedom, human rights have come to have a definite meaning to the people of theworld which we must not allow any nation to so change that they are made synonymous withsuppression and dictatorship. There are basic differences that show up even in the use of wordsbetween a democratic and a totalitarian country. For instance ""democracy"" meansone thing to the U.S.S.R. and another the U.S.A. and, I know, in France. I have servedsince the first meeting of the nuclear commission on the Human Rights Commission, and Ithink this point stands out clearly. The U.S.S.R. Representatives assert that they already have achievedmany things which we, in what they call the ""bourgeois democracies"" cannotachieve because their government controls the accomplishment of these things. Ourgovernment seems powerless to them because, in the last analysis, it is controlled by thepeople. They would not put it that way -- they would say that the people in the U.S.S.R.control their government by allowing their government to have certain absolute rights. We,on the other hand, feel that certain rights can never be granted to the government, butmust be kept in the hands of the people. For instance, the U.S.S.R. will assert that their press is freebecause the state makes it free by providing the machinery, the paper, and even the moneyfor salaries for the people who work on the paper. They state that there is no controlover what is printed in the various papers that they subsidize in this manner, such, forinstance, as a trade-union paper. But what would happen if a paper were to print ideaswhich were critical of the basic policies and beliefs of the Communist government.? I amsure some good reason would be found for abolishing the paper. It is true that they have been many cases where newspapers in theU.S.S.R. have criticized officials and their actions and have been responsible for theremoval of those officials, but in doing so they did not criticize anything which wasfundamental to Communist beliefs. They simply criticized methods of doing things, so onemust differentiate between things which are permissible, such as criticism of anyindividual or of the manner of doing things, and the criticism of a belief which would beconsidered vital to the acceptance of Communism. What are the differences, for instance, between trade-unions in thetotalitarian states and in the democracies? In the totalitarian state a trade-union is aninstrument used by the government to enforce duties, not to assert rights. Propagandamaterial which the government desires the workers to have is furnished by the trade-unionsto be circulated to their members. Our trade-unions, on the other hand, are solely the instrument ofthe workers themselves. They represent the workers in their relations with the governmentand with management and they are free to develop their own opinions without governmenthelp or interference. The concepts of our trade-unions and those in totalitarian countriesare drastically different. There is little mutual understanding. I think the best example one can give of this basic difference ofthe use of terms is “the right to work.” The Soviet Union insists that this is abasic right which it alone can guarantee because it alone provides full employment by thegovernment. But the right to work in the Soviet Union means the assignment of workers todo whatever task is given to them by the government without an opportunity for the peopleto participate in the decision that the government should do this. A society in whicheveryone works is not necessarily a free society and may indeed be a slave society; on theother hand, a society in which there is widespread economic insecurity can turn freedominto a barren and vapid right for millions of people. We in the United States have come to realize it means freedom tochoose one’s job, to work or not to work as one desires. We, in the United States,have come to realize, however, that people have a right to demand that their governmentwill not allow them to starve because as individuals they cannot find work of the kindthey are accustomed to doing and this is a decision brought about by public opinion whichcame as a result of the great depression in which many people were out of work, but wewould not consider in the United States that we had gained any freedom if we werecompelled to follow a dictatorial assignment to work where and when we were told. Theright of choice would seem to us an important, fundamental freedom. I have great sympathy with the Russian people. They love theircountry and have always defended it valiantly against invaders. They have been through aperiod of revolution, as a result of which they were for a time cut off from outsidecontact. They have not lost their resulting suspicion of other countries and the greatdifficulty is today that their government encourages this suspicion and seems to believethat force alone will bring them respect. We, in the democracies, believe in a kind of international respectand action which is reciprocal. We do not think others should treat us differently fromthe way they wish to be treated. It is interference in other countries that especiallystirs up antagonism against the Soviet Government. If it wishes to feel secure indeveloping its economic and political theories within its territory, then it should grantto others that same security. We believe in the freedom of people to make their ownmistakes. We do not interfere with them and they should not interfere with others. The basic problem confronting the world today, as I said in thebeginning, is the preservation of human freedom for the individual and consequently forthe society of which he is a part. We are fighting this battle again today as it wasfought at the time of the French Revolution and as the time of the American Revolution.The issue of human liberty is as decisive now as it was then. I want to give you myconception of what is meant in my country by freedom of the individual. Long ago in London during a discussion with Mr. Vyshinsky, he toldme there was no such thing as freedom for the individual in the world. All freedom of theindividual was conditioned by the rights of other individuals. That of course, I granted.I said: “We approach the question from a different point of view/ we here in theUnited Nations are trying to develop ideals which will be broader in outlook, which willconsider first the rights of man, which will consider what makes man more free; notgovernments, but man.” The totalitarian state typically places the will of the peoplesecond to decrees promulgated by a few men at the top.Naturally there must always be consideration of the rights of others; but in a democracythis is not a restriction. Indeed, in our democracies we make our freedoms secure becauseeach of us is expected to respect the rights of others and we are free to make our ownlaws. Freedom for our peoples is not only a right, but also a tool. Freedom of speech,freedom of the press, freedom of information, freedom of assembly -- these are not justabstract ideals to us; they are tools with which we create a way of life, a way of life inwhich we can enjoy freedom. Sometimes the processes of democracy are slow, and I have known someof our leaders to say that a benevolent dictatorship would accomplish the ends desired ina much shorter time than it takes to go through the democratic processes of discussion andthe slow formation of public opinion. But there is no way of insuring that a dictatorshipwill remain benevolent or that power once in the hands of a few will be returned to thepeople without struggle or revolution. This we have learned by experience and we acceptthe slow processes of democracy because we know that shortcuts compromise principles onwhich no compromise is possible. The final expression of the opinion of the people with us is throughfree and honest elections, with valid choices on basic issues and candidates. The secretballot is an essential to free elections but you must have a choice before you. I haveheard my husband say many times that a people need never lose their freedom if they kepttheir right to a secret ballot and if they used that secret ballot to the full. Basicdecisions of our society are made through the expressed will of the people. That is whywhen we see these liberties threatened, instead of falling apart, our nation becomesunified and our democracies come together as a unified group in spite of our variedbackgrounds and many racial strains. In the United States we have a capitalistic economy. That is becausepublic opinion favors that type of economy under the conditions in which we live. But wehave imposed certain restraints; for instance, we have antitrust laws. These are the legalevidence of the determination of the American people to maintain an economy of freecompetition and not to allow monopolies to take away the people’s freedom. Our trade-unions grow stronger because the people come to believethat this is the proper way to guarantee the rights of the workers and that the right toorganize and to bargain collectively keeps the balance between the actual producer an theinvestor of money and the manage in industry who watches over the man who works with thishands and who produces the materials which are out tangible wealth. In the United States we are old enough not to claim perfection. Werecognize that we have some problems of discrimination but we find steady progress beingmade in the solution of these problems. Through normal democratic processes we are comingto understand our needs and how we can attain full equality for all our people. Freediscussion on the subject is permitted. Our Supreme Court has recently rendered decisionsto clarify a number of our laws to guarantee the rights of all. The U.S.S.R. claims it has reached a point where all races withinher borders are officially considered equal and have equal rights and they insist thatthey have no discrimination where minorities are concerned. This is a laudable objective but there are other aspects of thedevelopment of freedom for the individual which are essential before the mere absence ofdiscrimination is worth much, and these are lacking in the Soviet Union. Unless they arebeing denied freedoms which they want and which they see other people have, people do notusually complain of discrimination. It is these other freedoms -- the basic freedoms ofspeech, of the press, of religion and conscience, of assembly, of fair trial and freedomfrom arbitrary arrest and punishment, which a totalitarian government cannot safely giveits people and which give meaning to freedom from discrimination. It is my belief, and I am sure it is also yours, that the strugglefor democracy and freedom is a critical struggle, for their preservation is essential tothe great objective of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security.Among free men the end cannot justify the means. We know the patterns of totalitarianism-- the single political party, the control of schools, press, radio, the arts, thesciences, and the church to support autocratic authority; these are the age-old patternsagainst which men have struggled for three thousand years. These are the signs ofreaction, retreat, and retrogression. The United Nations must hold fast to the heritage offreedom won by the struggle of its people; it must help us to pass it on to generations tocome. The development of the ideal of freedom and its translation into theeveryday life of the people in great areas of the earth is the product of the efforts ofmany peoples. It is the fruit of a long tradition of vigorous thinking and courageousaction. No one race and on one people can claim to have done all the work to achievegreater dignity for human beings and great freedom to develop human personality. In eachgeneration and in each country there must be a continuation of the struggle and new stepsforward must be taken since this is preeminently a field in which to stand still is toretreat. The field of human rights is not one in which compromise onfundamental principles are possible. The work of the Commission on Human Rights isillustrative. The Declaration of Human Rights provides: “Everyone has the right toleave any country, including his own.” The Soviet Representative said he would agreeto this right if a single phrase was added to it -- ”in accordance with the procedurelaid down in the laws of that country.” It is obvious that to accept this would benot only to compromise but to nullify the right stated. This case forcefully illustratesthe importance of the proposition that we must ever be alert not to compromise fundamentalhuman rights merely for the sake of reaching unanimity and thus lose them. As I see it, it is not going to be easy to attain unanimity withrespect to our different concepts of government and human rights. The struggle is bound tobe difficult and one in which we must be firm but patient. If we adhere faithfully to ourprinciples I think it is possible for us to maintain freedom and to do so peacefully andwithout recourse to force. The future must see the broadening of human rights throughout theworld. People who have glimpsed freedom will never be content until they have secured itfor themselves. In a truest sense, human rights are a fundamental object of law andgovernment in a just society. Human rights exist to the degree that they are respected bypeople in relations with each other and by governments in relations with their citizens. The world at large is aware of the tragic consequences for humanbeings ruled by totalitarian systems. If we examine Hitler’s rise to power, we seehow the chains are forged which keep the individual a slave and we cans e manysimilarities in the way things are accomplished in other countries. Politically men mustbe free to discuss and to arrive at as many facts as possible and there must beat least atwo-party system in a country because when there is only one political party, too manythings can be subordinated to the interests of that one party and it becomes a tyrant andnot an instrument of democratic government. The propaganda we have witnessed in the recent past, like that weperceive in these days, seeks to impugn, to undermine, and to destroy the liberty andindependence of peoples. Such propaganda poses to all peoples the issue whether to doubttheir heritage of rights and therefore to compromise the principles by which they live, ortry to accept the challenge, redouble their vigilance, and stand steadfast in the struggleto maintain and enlarge human freedoms. People who continue to be denied the respect to which they areentitled as human beings will not acquiesce forever in such denial. The Charter of the United Nations is a guiding beacon along the wayto the achievement of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world. Theimmediate test is not only to the extent to which human rights and freedoms have alreadybeen achieved, but the direction in which the world is moving. Is there a faithfulcompliance with the objectives of the Charter if some countries continue to curtail humanrights and freedoms instead of to promote the universal respect for an observance of humanrights and freedoms for all as called for by the Charter? The place to discuss the issue of human rights is in the forum ofthe United Nations. The United Nations has been set up as the common meeting ground fornations, where we can consider together our mutual problems and take advantage of ourdifferences in experience. It is inherent in our firm attachment to democracy and freedomthat we stand always ready to use the fundamental democratic procedures of honestdiscussion and negotiation. It is now as always our hope that despite the wide differencesin approach we face in the world today, we can with mutual good faith in the principles ofthe united Nations Charter, arrive at a common basis of understanding. We are here to join the meetings of this great internationalAssembly which meets in your beautiful capital of Paris. Freedom for the individual is aninseparable part of the cherished traditions of France.

1984 Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Address,Geraldine Ferraro,1984,"Ladies and gentlemen of the convention: My name is Geraldine Ferraro. I stand before you to proclaim tonight:America is the land where dreams can come true for all of us. As I standbefore the American people and think of the honor this great conventionhas bestowed upon me, I recall the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,who made America stronger by making America more free. He said, ""Occasionallyin life there are moments which cannot be completely explained by words.Their meaning can only be articulated by the inaudible language of theheart."" Tonight is such a moment for me. My heart is filled with pride. My fellow citizens, I proudly acceptyour nomination for Vice President of the United States. And I am proud to run with a man who will be one of the great Presidentsof this century, Walter F. Mondale. Tonight, the daughter of a woman whosehighest goal was a future for her children talks to our nation's oldestparty about a future for us all. Tonight, the daughter of working Americanstells all Americans that the future is within our reach, if we're willingto reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has beenchosen to run for [Vice] President in the new land my father came to love. Our faith that we can shape a better future is what the American dreamis all about. The promise of our country is that the rules are fair. Ifyou work hard and play by the rules, you can earn your share of America'sblessings. Those are the beliefs I learned from my parents. And those arethe values I taught my students as a teacher in the public schools of NewYork City. At night, I went to law school. I became an assistant district attorney,and I put my share of criminals behind bars. I believe if you obey thelaw, you should be protected. But if you break the law, you must pay foryour crime. When I first ran for Congress, all the political experts said a Democratcould not win my home district in Queens. I put my faith in the peopleand the values that we shared. Together, we proved the political expertswrong. In this campaign, Fritz Mondale and I have put our faith in thepeople. And we are going to prove the experts wrong again. We are goingto win. We are going to win because Americans across this country believein the same basic dream. Last week, I visited Elmore, Minnesota, the small town where Fritz Mondalewas raised. And soon Fritz and Joan will visit our family in Queens. Ninehundred people live in Elmore. In Queens, there are 2,000 people on oneblock. You would think we'd be different, but we're not. Children walkto school in Elmore past grain elevators; in Queens, they pass by subwaystops. But, no matter where they live, their future depends on education,and their parents are willing to do their part to make those schools asgood as they can be. In Elmore, there are family farms; in Queens, smallbusinesses. But the men and women who run them all take pride in supportingtheir families through hard work and initiative. On the 4th of July inElmore, they hang flags out on Main Street; in Queens, they fly them overGrand Avenue. But all of us love our country, and stand ready to defendthe freedom that it represents. Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration,the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right thatevery year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up,while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.The rules say: Everyone in our society should contribute their fair share.It isn't right that this year Ronald Reagan will hand the American peoplea bill for interest on the national debt larger than the entire cost ofthe federal government under John F. Kennedy. Our parents left us a growingeconomy. The rules say: We must not leave our kids a mountain of debt. It isn't right that a woman should get paid 59 cents on the dollar forthe same work as a man. If you play by the rules, you deserve a fair day's pay for a fair day'swork. It isn't right that, if trends continue, by the year 2000 nearlyall of the poor people in America will be women and children. The rulesof a decent society say: When you distribute sacrifice in times of austerity,you don't put women and children first. It isn't right that young peopletoday fear they won't get the Social Security they paid for, and that olderAmericans fear that they will lose what they have already learned [earned]. SocialSecurity is a contract between the last generation and the next, and therules say: You don't break contracts. We are going to keep faith with older Americans. We hammered out a faircompromise in the Congress to save Social Security. Every group sacrificedto keep the system sound. It is time Ronald Reagan stopped scaring oursenior citizens. It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring childreninto a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more thantwo centuries. And our future doesn't have to be that way. Change is inthe air, just as surely as when John Kennedy beckoned America to a newfrontier; when Sally Ride rocketed into space; and when Reverend JesseJackson ran for the office of President of the United States. By choosing a woman to run for our nation's second highest office, yousend a powerful signal to all Americans: There are no doors we cannot unlock.We will place no limits on achievement. If we can do this, we can do anything. Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of Americanlife work fairly for all Americans again. To an Administration that wouldhave us debate all over again whether the Voting Rights Act should be renewedand whether segregated schools should be tax exempt, we say, Mr. President:Those debates are over. On the issue of civil rights, voting rights, andaffirmative action for minorities, we must not go backwards. We must --and we will -- move forward to open the doors of opportunity. To those who understand that our country cannot prosper unless we drawon the talents of all Americans, we say: We will pass the Equal RightsAmendment. The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can dofor America. To the Americans who will lead our country into the 21st century, wesay: We will not have a Supreme Court that turns the clock back to the19th century. To those concerned about the strength of American and family values,as I am, I say: We are going to restore those values -- love, caring, partnership-- by including, and not excluding, those whose beliefs differ from ourown. Because our own faith is strong, we will fight to preserve the freedomof faith for others. To those working Americans who fear that banks, utilities, and largespecial interests have a lock on the White House, we say: Join us; let'select the people's President; and let's have government by and for the Americanpeople again. To an Administration that would savage student loans and education atthe dawn of a new technological age, we say: You fit the classic definitionof a cynic; you know the price of everything, but the value of nothing. To our students and their parents, we say: We will insist on the higheststandards of excellence, because the jobs of the future require skilledminds. To young Americans who may be called to our country's service, wesay: We know your generation will proudly answer our country's call, aseach generation before you. This past year, we remembered the bravery and sacrifice of Americansat Normandy. And we finally paid tribute -- as we should have done yearsago -- to that Unknown Soldier who represents all the brave young Americanswho died in Vietnam. Let no one doubt, we will defend America's securityand the cause of freedom around the world. But we want a President whotells us what America's fighting for, not just what we are fighting against. We want a President who will defend human rights, not just where itis convenient, but wherever freedom is at risk -- from Chile to Afghanistan,from Poland to South Africa. To those who have watched this administration'sconfusion in the Middle East, as it has tilted first toward one and thenanother of Israel's long-time enemies and wonder: ""Will America stand byher friends and sister democracy?"" we say: America knows who her friendsare in the Middle East and around the world. America will stand with Israelalways. Finally, we want a President who will keep America strong, but use thatstrength to keep America and the world at peace. A nuclear freeze is nota slogan: It is a tool for survival in the nuclear age. If we leave ourchildren nothing else, let us leave them this Earth as we found it: wholeand green and full of life. I know in my heart that Walter Mondale will be that President. A wise man once said, ""Every one of us is given the gift of life, andwhat a strange gift it is. If it is preserved jealously and selfishly,it impoverishes and saddens. But if it is spent for others, it enrichesand beautifies."" My fellow Americans: We can debate policies and programs,but in the end what separates the two parties in this election campaignis whether we use the gift of life for others or only ourselves. Tonight, my husband, John, and our three children are in this hall withme. To my daughters, Donna and Laura, and my son, John Junior, I say: Mymother did not break faith with me, and I will not break faith with you. To all the children of America, I say: The generation before ours keptfaith with us, and like them, we will pass on to you a stronger, more justAmerica. Thank you.  "
 Address to the Jury,Emma Goldman,1917,"Gentlemen of the Jury: As in the case of my co-defendant, Alexander Berkman, this is also the first time in my life I have ever addressed a jury.  I once had occasion to speak to three judges. On the day after our arrest it was give out by the U. S. Marshal and the District Attorneys office that the big fish of the No-Conscription activities had been caught, and that there would be no more trouble-makers and disturbers to interfere with the highly democratic effort of the Government to conscript its young manhood for the European slaughter.  What a pity that the faithful servants of the Government, personified in the U. S. Marsha land the District Attorney, should have used such a weak and flimsy net for their big catch.  The moment the anglers pulled their heavily laden net ashore, it broke, and all the labor was so much wasted energy. The methods employed by Marshal McCarthy and his hosts of heroic warriors were sensational enough to satisfy the famous circus men, Barnum & Baily.  A dozen or more heroes dashing up two flights of stairs, prepared to stake their lives for their country, only to discover the two dangerous disturbers and trouble-makers Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman, in their separate offices, quietly at work at their desks, wielding not a sword, nor a gun or a bomb, but merely their pens!  Verily, it required courage to catch such big fish. To be sure, tow officers equipped with a warrant would have sufficed to carry out the business of arresting the defendants Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman.  Even the police know that neither of them is in the habit of running away or hiding under the bed.  But the farce-comedy had to be properly staged if the Marshal and the District Attorney were to earn immortality.  Hence the sensational arrest; hence, also, the raid upon the offices of THE BLAST, MOTHER EARTH and the No-Conscription League. In their zeal to save the country from the trouble-makers, the Marshal and his helpers did not even consider it necessary to produce a search warrant.  After all, what matters a mere scrap of paper when one is called upon to raid the offices of Anarchists! Of what consequence is the sanctity of property, the right of privacy, to officials in their dealings with Anarchists!  In our day of military training for battle, and Anarchist office is an appropriate camping ground.  Would the gentlemen who came with Marshal McCarthy have dared to go into the offices of Morgan, of Rockefeller, or of any of those men without a search warrant?  They never showed us the search warrant, although we asked them for it.  Nevertheless, they turned our office into a battlefield, so that when they were through with it, it looked like invaded Belgium, with the only difference that the invaders were not Prussian barbarians but good American patriots bent on making New York safe for democracy. The stage having been appropriately set for the three-act comedy, and the first act successfully played by carrying off the villains in a madly dashing automobile -- which broke every traffic regulation and barely escaped crushing every one in its way--the second act proved even more ludicrous.  Fifty thousand dollars bail was demanded, and real estate refused when offered by a man whose property is rated at three hundred thousand dollars, and that after the District Attorney had considered and, in fact, promised to accept the property for one of the defendants, Alexander Berkman, thus breaking every right guaranteed even to the most heinous criminal. Finally the third act, played by the Government in this court during the last week.  The pity of it is that the prosecution knows so little of dramatic construction, else it would have equipped itself with better dramatic material to sustain the continuity of the play.  As it was, the third act fell flat, utterly, and presents the question, Why such a tempest in a teapot? Gentlemen of the jury, my comrade and co-defendant having carefully and thoroughly gone into the evidence presented by the prosecution, and having demonstrated its entire failure to prove the charge of conspiracy or any overt acts to carry out that conspiracy, I shall not impose upon your patience by going over the same ground, except to emphasize a few points.  To charge people with having conspired to do something which they have been engaged in doing most of their lives, namely their campaign against war, militarism and conscription as contrary to the best interests of humanity, is an insult to human intelligence. And how was that charge proven?  By the fact that MOTHER EARTH and THE BLAST were printed by the same printer and bound in the same bindery.  By the further evidence that the same expressman had delivered to two publications!  An by the still more illuminating fact that on June 2nd MOTHER EARTH and THE BLAST were given to a reporter at his request, if your please, and gratis. Gentlemen of the jury, you saw the reporter who testified to this overt act.  Did any one of you receive the impression that the man was of conscriptable age, and if not in what possible way is the giving of MOTHER EARTH  to a report for news purposes proof demonstrating the overt act? It was brought out by our witnesses that the MOTHER EARTH magazine has been published for twelve years; that it was never held up, and that it has always gone through the U. S. mail as second-class mail matter.  It was further proven that the magazine appeared each month about the first or second, and that it was sold or given away at the office to whoever wanted a copy.  Where, then, is the overt act? Just as the prosecution has utterly failed to prove the charge of conspiracy, so has it also failed to prove the overt act by the flimsy testimony that MOTHER EARTH was given to a reporter.  The same holds good regarding THE BLAST. Gentlemen of the jury, the District Attorney must have learned from the reporters the gist of the numerous interviews which they had with us.  Why did he not examine them as to whether or not we had counseled young men not to register?  That would have been a more direct way of getting at the facts.  In the case of the reporter from the New York Times, there can be no doubt that the man would have been only too happy to accommodate the District Attorney with the required information.  A man who disregards every principle of decency and ethics of his profession as a newspaper man, by turning material given him as news over to the District Attorney, would have been glad to oblige a friend.  Why did Mr. Content neglect such a golden opportunity?  Was it no because the reporter of the Times, like all the other reporters, must have told the District Attorney that the two defendants stated, on each and every occasion, they would not tell people not to register? Perhaps the Times reporter refused to go to the extent of perjuring himself.  Patrolmen and detectives are not so timid in such matters.  Hence Mr. Randolph and Mr. Cadell, to rescue the situation.  Imagine employing tenth-rate stenographers to report the very important speeches of dangerous trouble-makers!  What lack of forethought and efficiency on the part of the District Attorney!  But even these two members of the police department failed to prove by their notes that we advised people not to register.  But since they had to produce something incriminating against Anarchists, they conveniently resorted to the old standby, always credited to us, We believe in violence and we will use violence. Assuming, gentlemen of the jury, that his sentence was really used at the meeting of May 18th, it would still fail to prove the indictment which charges conspiracy and overt acts to carry out the conspiracy.  And that is all we are charged with.  Not violence, not Anarchism.  I will go further and say, that had the indictment been for the advocacy of violence, you gentlemen of the jury, would still have to render a verdict of Not Guilty, since the mere belief in a thing or even the announcement that you would carry out that belief, can not possibly constitute a crime. However, I wish to say emphatically that no such expression as We believe in violence and we will use violence was uttered at the meeting of May 18th, or at any other meeting.  I could not have employed such a phrase, as there was no occasion for it.  If for no other reason, it is because I want my lectures and speeches to be coherent and logical.  The sentence credited to me is neither. I have read to you my position toward political violence from a lengthy essay called The Psychology of Political Violence. But to make that a position clearer and simpler, I wish to say that I am a social student.  It is my mission in life to ascertain the cause of our social evils and of our social difficulties.  As a student of social wrongs it is my aim to diagnose a wrong.  To simply condemn the man who has committed an act of political violence, in order to save my skin, would be as unpardonable as it would be on the part of the physician, who is called to diagnose a case, to condemn the patient because the patient has tuberculosis, caner, or some other disease.  The honest, earnest, sincere physician does not only prescribe medicine, he tries to find out the cause of the disease.  And if the patient is at all capable as to means, the doctor will say to him, Get out of this putrid air, get out of the factory, get out of the place where your lungs are being infected.  He will not merely give him medicine.  He will tell him the cause of the disease.  And that is precisely my position in regard to acts of violence.  That is what I have said on every platform.  I have attempted to explain the cause and the reason for acts of political violence. It is organized violence on top which creates individual violence at the bottom.  It is the accumulated indignation against organized wrong, organized crime, organized injustice which drives the political offender to his act.  To condemn him means to be blind to the causes which make him.  I can no more do it, nor have I the right to, than the physician who were to condemn the patient for his disease.  You and I and all of us who remain indifferent to the crimes of poverty, of war, of human degradation, are equally responsible for the act committed by the political offender.  May I therefore be permitted to say, in the words of a great teacher:  He who is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone.  Does that mean advocating violence?  You might as well accuse Jesus of advocating prostitution, because He took the part of the prostitute, Mary Magdalene. Gentlemen of the jury, the meeting of the 18th of May was called primarily for the purpose of voicing the position of the conscientious objector and to point out the evils of conscription.  Now, who and what is the conscientious objector?  Is he really a shirker, a slacker, or a coward?  To call him that is to be guilty of dense ignorance of the forces which impel men and women to stand out against the whole world like a glittering lone star upon a dark horizon.  The conscientious objector is impelled by what President Wilson in his speech of Feb. 3, 1917, called the righteous passion for justice upon which all war, all structure of family, State and of mankind must rest as the ultimate base of our existence or our liberty.  The righteous passion for justice which can never express itself in human slaughter -- that is the force which makes the conscientious objector.  Poor indeed is the country which fails to recognize the importance of that new type of humanity as the ultimate base of our existence and liberty.  It will find itself barren of that which makes for character and quality in its people. The meeting of May 18th was held before the Draft Bill had actually gone into effect.  The President signed it late in the evening of the 18th.  Whatever was said at the meeting, even if I had counseled young men not to register, that meeting cannot serve as proof of an overt act.  Why, then, has the Prosecuting Attorney dwelt so much, at such length, and with such pains on that meeting, and so little on the other meetings held on the eve of registration and after?  Is it not because the District Attorney knew that we had no stenographic notes of that meeting?  He knew it because he was approached by Mr. Weinberger and other friends for a copy of the transcript, which request he refused.  Evidently, the District Attorney felt safe to use the notes of a patrolman and a detective, knowing that they would swear to anything their superiors wanted.  I never like to accuse anyone -- I wouldnt go so far as my co-defendant, Mr. Berkman, in saying that the District Attorney doctored the document; I dont know whether he did or not.  But I do know that Patrolman Randolph and Detective Cadell doctored the notes, for the simple reason that I didnt say those things.  But though we could not produce our own stenographic notes, we have been able to prove by men and women of unimpeachable character and high intelligence that the notes of Randolph are utterly false.  We have also proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and Mr. Content did not dare question our proof, that at the Hunts Point Palace, held on the eve or registration, I expressly stated that I cannot and will not tell people not to register.  We have further proven that this was my definite stand, which was explained in my statement sent from Springfield and read at the meeting of May 23rd. When we go through the entire testimony given on behalf of the prosecution, I insist that there is not one single point to sustain the indictment for conspiracy or to prove the overt acts we are supposed to have committed.  But we were even compelled to bring a man eighty years of age to the witness stand in order to stop, if possible, and intention to drag in the question of German money.  It is true, and I appreciate it, that Mr. Content said he had no knowledge of it.  But, gentlemen of the jury, somebody from the District Attorneys office or someone from the Marshals office must have given out the statement that a bank receipt for $2,400 was found in my office and must have told the newspapers the fake story of German money.  As if we would ever touch German money, or Russian money, or American money coming from the ruling class, to advance our ideas !  But in order to forestall any suspicion, any insinuation, in order to stand clear before you, we were compelled to bring an old man here to inform you that he has been a radical all his life, that he is interested in our ideas, and that he is the man who contributed the money for radical purposes and for the work of Miss Goldman. Gentlemen of the jury, you will be told by the Court, I am sure, that when you render a verdict you must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt; that you must not assume that we are guilty before we are proven guilty; and that it is your duty to assume that we are innocent.  And yet, as a matter of fact, the burden of proof has been laid upon us.  We had to bring witnesses.  If we had had time we could have brought fifty more witnesses, each corroborating the others.  Some of those people have no relation with us.  Some are writers, poets, contributors to the most conventional magazines.  Is it likely that they would swear to something in our favor if it were not the truth?  Therefore I insist, as did my co-defendant Alexander Berkman, that the prosecution has made a very poor showing in proving the conspiracy or any overt act. Gentlemen of the jury, we have been in public life for twenty-seven years.  We have been haled into court, in and out of season -- we have never denied our position.  Even the police know that Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman are not shirkers.  You have had occasion during this trial to convince yourselves that we do not deny.  We have gladly and proudly claimed responsibility, not only for what we ourselves have said and written, but even for things written by others and with which we did not agree.  Is it plausible, then, that we would go through the ordeal, trouble and expense of a lengthy trial to escape responsibility in this instance?  A thousand times no!  But we refuse to be tried on a trumped-up charge, or to be convicted by perjured testimony, merely because we are Anarchists and hated by the class whom we have openly fought for many years. Gentlemen, during our examination of talesmen, when we asked whether you would be prejudiced against us if it were proven that we propagated ideas and opinions contrary to those held by the majority, you were instructed by the Court to say, If they are within the law.  But what the Court did not tell you is, that no new faith -- not even the most humane and peaceable -- has ever been considered within the law by those who were in power.  The history of human growth is at the same time the history of every new idea heralding the approach of a brighter dawn, and the brighter dawn has always been considered illegal, outside of the law. Gentlemen of the jury, most of you, I take it, are believers in the teachings of Jesus.  Bear in mind that he was put to death by those who considered his views as being against the law.  I also take it that you are proud of you Americanism.  Remember that those who fought and bled for your liberties were in their time considered as being against the law, as dangerous disturbers and trouble-makers.  They not only preached violence, but they carried out their ideas by throwing tea into the Boston harbor.  They said that Resistance to tyranny is obedience to God.  They wrote a dangerous document called the Declaration of Independence.  A document which continues to be dangerous to this day, and for the circulation of which a young man was sentenced to ninety days prison in a New Your Court, only the other day.  They were the Anarchists of their time -- they were never within the law. Your Government is allied with the French Republic.  Need I call you attention to the historic fact that the great upheaval in France was brought about by extra-legal means?  The Dantes, the Robespieres, the Marats, the Herberts, aye even the man who is responsible for the most stirring revolutionary music, the Marseillaise (which unfortunately has deteriorated into a war tune) even Camille Desmoulins, were never within the law.  But for those great pioneers and rebels, France would have continued under the yoke of the idle Louis XVI., to whom the sport of shooting jack rabbits was more important than the destiny of the people of France. Ah, gentlemen, on the very day when we were being tried for conspiracy and overt acts, your city officials and representatives welcomed with music and festivities the Russian Commission.  Are you aware of the fact that nearly all of the members of that Commission have only recently been released from exile?  The ideas they propagated were never within the law.  For nearly a hundred years, from 1825 to 1917, the Tree of Liberty in Russia was watered by the blood of her martyrs.  No greater heroism, no nobler lives had ever been dedicated to humanity.  Not one of them worked within the law.  I could continue to enumerate almost endlessly the hosts of men and women in every land and in every period whose ideas and ideals redeemed the world because they were not within the law. Never can a new idea move within the law.  It matters not whether that idea pertains to political and social changes or to any other domain of human thought and expression -- to science, literature, music; in fact, everything that makes for freedom and joy and beauty must refuse to move within the law.  How can it be otherwise?  The law is stationary, fixed, mechanical, a chariot wheel which grinds all alike without regard to time, place and condition, without ever taking into account cause and effect, without ever going into the complexity of the human soul. Progress knows nothing of fixity.  It cannot be pressed into a definite mould.  It cannot bow to the dictum, I have ruled, I am the regulating finger of God.  Progress is ever renewing, ever becoming, ever changing -- never is it within the law. If that be crime, we are criminals even like Jesus, Socrates, Galileo, Bruno, John Brown and scores of others.  We are in good company, among those whom Havelock Ellis, the greatest living psychologist, describes as the political criminals recognized by the whole civilized world, except America, as men and women who out of deep love for humanity, out of a passionate reverence for liberty and an all-absorbing devotion to an ideal are ready to pay for their faith even with their blood.  We cannot do otherwise if we are to be true to ourselves -- we know that the political criminal is the precursor of human progress -- the political criminal of today must needs be the hero, the martyr and the saint of the new age. But, says the Prosecuting Attorney, the press and the unthinking rabble, in high and low station, that is a dangerous doctrine and unpatriotic at this time.  No doubt it is.  But are we to be held responsible for something which is as unchangeable and unalienable as the very stars hanging in the heavens unto time and all eternity? Gentlemen to the jury, we respect your patriotism.  We would not, if we could, have you change its meaning for yourself.  But may there not be different kinds of patriotism as there are different kinds of liberty?  I for one cannot believe that love of ones country must needs consist in blindness to its social faults, to deafness to its social discords, of inarticulation to its social wrongs.  Neither can I believe that the mere accident of birth in a certain country or the mere scrap of a citizens paper constitutes the love of country. I know many people -- I am one of them -- who were not born here, nor have the applied for citizenship, and who yet love America with deeper passion and greater intensity that many natives whose patriotism manifests itself by pulling, kicking, and insulting those who do not rise when the national anthem is played.  Our patriotism is that of the man who loves a woman with open eyes.  He is enchanted by her beauty, yet he sees her faults.  So we, too, who know America, love her beauty, her richness, her great possibilities; we love her mountains, her canyons, her forests, her Niagara, and her deserts -- above all do we love the people that have produced her wealth, her artists who have created beauty, her great apostles who dream and work for liberty -- but with the same passionate emotion we hate her superficiality, her cant, her corruption, her mad, unscrupulous worship at the alter of the Golden Calf. We say that if America has entered the war to make the world safe for democracy, she must first make democracy safe in America.  How else is the world to take America seriously, when democracy at home is daily being outrages, free speech suppressed, peaceable assemblies broken up by overbearing and brutal gangsters in uniform; when free press is curtailed and every independent opinion gagged.  Verily, poor as we are in democracy, how can we give of it to the world?  We further say that a democracy conceived in the military servitude of the masses, in their economic enslavement, and nurtured in their tears and blood, is not democracy at all.  It is despotism -- the cumulative result of a chain of abuses which, according to the dangerous document ,the Declaration of Independence, the people have the right to overthrow. The District Attorney has dragged in our Manifesto, and he has emphasized the passage, Resist conscription.  Gentlemen of the jury, please remember that that is not the charge against us.  But admitting that the Manifesto contains the expression, Resist conscription, may I ask you, is there only one kind of resistance?  Is there only the resistance which means the gun, the bayonet, the bomb or flying machine?  Is there not another kind of resistance?  May not the people simply fold their hands and declare, We will not fight when we do not believe in the necessity of war?  May not the people who believe in the repeal of the Conscription Law, because it is unconstitutional, express their opposition in word and by pen, in meetings and in other ways?  What right has the District Attorney to interpret that particular passage to suit himself?  Moreover, gentlemen of the jury, I insist that the indictment against us does not refer to conscription.  We are charged with a conspiracy against registration.  And in no way or manner has the prosecution proven that we are guilty of conspiracy or that we have committed an overt act. Gentlemen of the jury, you are not called upon to accept our views, to approve of them or to justify them.  You are not even called upon to decide whether our views are within or against the law.  You are called upon to decide whether the prosecution has proven that the defendants Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman have conspired to urge people not to register.  And whether their speeches and writings represent overt acts. Whatever you verdict, gentlemen, it cannot possibly affect the rising tide of discontent in this country against war which, despite all boasts, is a war for conquest and military power.  Neither can it affect the ever increasing opposition to conscription which is a military and industrial yoke placed upon the necks of the American people.  Least of all will your verdict affect those to whom human life is sacred, and who will not become a party to the world slaughter.  Your verdict can only add to the opinion of the world as to whether or not justice and liberty are a living force in this country or a mere shadow of the past. Your verdict may, of course, affect us temporarily, in a physical sense -- it can have no effect whatever upon our spirit.  For even if we were convicted and found guilty and the penalty were that we be placed against a wall and shot dead, I should nevertheless cry out with the great Luther:  Here I am and her I stand and I cannot do otherwise. And gentlemen, in conclusion let me tell you that my co-defendant, Mr. Berkman, was right when he said the eyes of America are upon you.  They are upon you not because of sympathy for us or agreement with Anarchism.  They are upon you because it must decided sooner or later whether we are justified in telling people that we will give the democracy in Europe, when we have no democracy here?  Shall free speech and free assemblage, shall criticism and opinion -- which even the espionage bill did not include -- be destroyed?  Shall it be a shadow of the past, the great historic American past?  Shall it be trampled underfoot by any detective, or policeman, anyone who decides upon it?  Or shall free speech and free press and free assemblage continue to be the heritage of the American people? Gentlemen of the jury, whatever you verdict will be, as far as we are concerned, nothing will be changed.  I have held ideas all my life.  I have publicly held my ideas for twenty-seven years.  Nothing on earth would ever make me change my ideas except one thing; and that is, if you will prove to me that our position is wrong, untenable, or lacking in historic fact.  But never would I change my ideas because I am found guilty.  I may remind you of two great Americans, undoubtedly not unknown to you, gentlemen of the jury;  Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.  When Thoreau was placed in prison for refusing to pay taxes, he was visited by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Emerson said:  David, what are you doing in jail?  and Thoreau replied:   Ralph, what are you doing outside, when honest people are in jail for their ideals?  Gentlemen of  the jury, I do not wish to influence you.  I do not wish to appeal to you passions.  I do not wish to influence you by the fact that I am a woman.  I have no such desires and no such designs.  I take it that you are sincere enough and honest enough and brave enough to render a verdict according to you convictions, beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt. Please forget that we are Anarchists.  Forget that it is claimed that we propagated violence.  Forget that something appeared in MOTHER EARTH when I was thousands of miles away, three years ago.  Forget all that, and merely consider the evidence.  Have we been engaged in a conspiracy?  has that conspiracy been proven?  have we committed overt acts?  have those overt acts been proven?  We for the defense say they have not been proven.  And therefore your verdict must be not guilty. But whatever your decision, the struggle must go on.  We are but the atoms in the incessant human struggle towards the light that shines in the darkness -- the Ideal of economic, political and spiritual liberation of mankind!  "
The Crisis,Carrie Chapman Catt,1916,"I have taken for my subject, ""The Crisis,"" because I believe that a crisis has come in our movement which, if recognized and the opportunity seized with vigor, enthusiasm and will, means the final victory of our great cause in the very near future. I am aware that some suffragists do not share this belief; they see no signs nor symptoms today which were not present yesterday; no manifestations in the year 1916 which differ significantly from those in the year 1910. To them, the movement has been a steady, normal growth from the beginning and must so continue until the end. I can only defend my claim with the plea that it is better to imagine a crisis where none exists than to fail to recognize one when it comes; for a crisis is a culmination of events which calls for new considerations and new decisions. A failure to answer the call may mean an opportunity lost, a possible victory postponed. The object of the life of an organized movement is to secure its aim. Necessarily, it must obey the law of evolution and pass through the stages of agitation and education and finally through the stage of realization. As one has put it: ""A new idea floats in the air over the heads of the people and for a long, indefinite period evades their understanding but, by and by, when through familiarity, human vision grows clearer, it is caught out of the clouds and crystallized into law."" Such a period comes to every movement and is its crisis. In my judgment, that crucial moment, bidding us to renewed consecration and redoubled activity has come to our cause. I believe our victory hangs within our grasp, inviting us to pluck it out of the clouds and establish it among the good things of the world. If this be true, the time is past when we should say: ""Men and women of America, look upon that wonderful idea up there; see, one day it will come down."" Instead, the time has come to shout aloud in every city, village and hamlet, and in tones so clear and jubilant that they will reverberate from every mountain peak and echo from shore to shore: ""The woman's Hour has struck."" Suppose suffragists as a whole do not believe a crisis has come and do not extend their hands to grasp the victory, what will happen? Why, we shall all continue to work and our cause will continue to hang, waiting for those who possess a clearer vision and more daring enterprise. On the other hand, suppose we reach out with united earnestness and determination to grasp our victory while it still hangs a bit too high? Has any harm been done? None! Therefore, fellow suffragists, I invite your attention to the signs which point to a crisis and your consideration of plans for turning the crisis into victory. First, we are passing through a world crisis. All thinkers of every land tell us so; and that nothing after the great war will be as it was before. Those who profess to know, claim that 100 millions of dollars are being spent on the war every day and that 2 years of war have cost 50 billions of dollars or 10 times more than the total expense of the American Civil War. Our own country has sent 35 millions of dollars abroad for relief expenses. Were there no other effects to come from the world's war, the transfer of such unthinkably vast sums of money from the usual avenues to those wholly abnormal would give so severe a jolt to organized society that it would vibrate around the world and bring untold changes in its wake. But three and a half millions of lives have been lost. The number becomes the more impressive when it is remembered that the entire population of the American Colonies was little more than three and one-half millions. These losses have been the lives of men within the age of economic production. They have been taken abruptly from the normal business of the world and every human activity from that of the humblest, unskilled labor to art, science and literature has been weakened by their loss. Millions of other men will go to their homes, blind, crippled and incapacitated to do the work they once performed. The stability of human institutions has never before suffered so tremendous a shock. Great men are trying to think out the consequences but one and all proclaim that no imagination can find color or form bold enough to paint the picture of the world after the war. British and Russian, German and Austrian, French and Italian agree that it will lead to social and political revolution throughout the entire world. Whatever comes, they further agree that the war presages a total change in the status of women. A simple-minded man in West Virginia, when addressed upon the subject of woman suffrage in that State, replied, ""We've been so used to keepin' our women down, 'twould seem queer not to."" He expressed what greater men feel but do not say. Had the wife of that man spoken in the same clear-thinking fashion, she would have said, ""We women have been so used to being kept down that it would seem strange to get up. Nature intended women for door-mats."" Had she so expressed herself, these two would have put the entire anti-suffrage argument in a nut-shell. In Europe, from the Polar Circle to the Aegean Sea, women have risen as though to answer that argument. Everywhere they have taken the places made vacant by men and in so doing, they have grown in self-respect and in the esteem of their respective nations. In every land, the people have reverted to the primitive division of labor and while the men have gone to war, women have cultivated the fields in order that the army and nation may be fed. No army can succeed and no nation can endure without food; those who supply it are a war power and a peace power. Women by the thousands have knocked at the doors of munition factories and, in the name of patriotism, have begged for the right to serve their country there. Their services were accepted with hesitation but the experiment once made, won reluctant but universal praise. An official statement recently issued in Great Britain announced that 660,000 women were engaged in making munitions in that country alone. In a recent convention of munition workers, composed of men and women, a resolution was unanimously passed informing the government that they would forego vacations and holidays until the authorities announced that their munition supplies were sufficient for the needs of the war and Great Britain pronounced the act the highest patriotism. Lord Derby addressed such a meeting and said, ""When the history of the war is written, I wonder to whom the greatest credit will be given; to the men who went to fight or to the women who are working in a way that many people hardly believed that it was possible for them to work."" Lord Sydenham added his tribute. Said he, ""It might fairly be claimed that women have helped to save thousands of lives and to change the entire aspect of the war. Wherever intelligence, care and close attention have been needed, women have distinguished themselves."" A writer in the London Times of July 18, 1916, said: ""But, for women, the armies could not have held the field for a month; the national call to arms could not have been made or sustained; the country would have perished of inanition and disorganization. If, indeed, it be true that the people have been one, it is because the genius of women has been lavishly applied to the task of reinforcing and complementing the genius of men. The qualities of steady industry, adaptability, good judgment and concentration of mind which men do not readily associate with women have been conspicuous features."" On fields of battle, in regular and improvised hospitals, women have given tender and skilled care to the wounded and are credited with the restoration of life to many, heroism and self-sacrifice have been frankly acknowledged by all the governments; but their endurance, their skill, the practicality of their service, seem for the first time, to have been recognized by governments as ""war power"". So, thinking in war terms, great men have suddenly discovered that women are ""war assets"". Indeed, Europe is realizing, as it never did before, that women are holding together the civilization for which men are fighting. A great search-light has been thrown upon the business of nation-building and it has been demonstrated in every European land that it is a partnership with equal, but different responsibilities resting upon the two partners. It is not, however, in direct war work alone that the latent possibilities of women have been made manifest. In all the belligerent lands, women have found their way to high posts of administration where no women would have been trusted two years ago and the testimony is overwhelming that they have filled their posts with entire satisfaction to the authorities. They have dared to stand in pulpits (once too sacred to be touched by the unholy feet of a woman) and there, without protest, have appealed to the Father of All in behalf of their stricken lands. They have come out of the kitchen where there was too little to cook and have found a way to live by driving cabs, motors and streetcars. Many a woman has turned her hungry children over to a neighbor and has gone forth to find food for both mothers and both families of children and has found it in strange places and occupations. Many a drawing-room has been closed and the maid who swept and dusted it is now cleaning streets that the health of the city may be conserved. Many a woman who never before slept in a bed of her own making, or ate food not prepared by paid labor, is now sole mistress of parlor and kitchen. In all the warring countries, women are postmen [sic], porters, railway conductors, ticket, switch and signal men. Conspicuous advertisements invite women to attend agricultural, milking and motor-car schools. They are employed as police in Great Britain and women detectives have recently been taken on the government staff. In Berlin, there are over 3,000 women streetcar conductors and 3,500 women are employed on the general railways. In every city and country, women are doing work for which they would have been considered incompetent two years ago. The war will soon end and the armies will return to their native lands. To many a family, the men will never come back. The husband who returns to many a wife, will eat no bread the rest of his life save of her earning. What then, will happen after the war? Will the widows left with families to support cheerfully leave their well-paid posts for those commanding lower wages? Not without protest! Will the wives who now must support crippled husbands give up their skilled work and take up the occupations which were open to them before the war? Will they resignedly say: ""The woman who has a healthy husband who can earn for her, has a right to tea and raisin cake, but the woman who earns for herself and a husband who has given his all to his country, must be content with butterless bread?"" Not without protest! On the contrary, the economic axiom, denied and evaded for centuries, will be blazoned on every factory, counting house and shop: ""Equal pay for equal work""; and common justice will slowly, but surely enforce that law. The European woman has risen. She may not realize it yet, but the woman ""door-mat"" in every land has unconsciously become a ""door-jamb""! She will have become accustomed to her new dignity by the time the men come home. She will wonder how she ever could have been content lying across the threshold now that she discovers the upright jamb gives so much broader and more normal a vision of things. The men returning may find the new order a bit queer but everything else will be strangely unfamiliar too, and they will soon grow accustomed to all the changes together. The ""jamb"" will never descend into a ""door-mat"" again. The male and female anti-suffragists of all lands will puff and blow at the economic change which will come to the women of Europe. They will declare it to be contrary to Nature and to God's plan and that somebody ought to do something about it. Suffragists will accept the change as the inevitable outcome of an unprecedented world's cataclysm over which no human agency had any control and will trust in God to adjust the altered circumstances to the eternal evolution of human society. They will remember that in the long run, all things work together for good, for progress and for human weal. The economic change is bound to bring political liberty. From every land, there comes the expressed belief that the war will be followed by a mighty, oncoming wave of democracy for it is now well known that the conflict has been one of governments, of kings and Czars, Kaisers and Emperors; not of peoples. The nations involved have nearly all declared that they are fighting to make an end of wars. New and higher ideals of governments and of the rights of the people under them, have grown enormously during the past two years. Another tide of political liberty, similar to that of 1848, but of a thousandfold greater momentum, is rising from battlefield and hospital, from camp and munitions factory, from home and church which, great men of many lands, tell us, is destined to sweep over the world. On the continent, the women say, ""It is certain that the vote will come to men and women after the war, perhaps not immediately but soon. In Great Britain, which was the storm centre of the suffrage movement for some years before the war, hundreds of bitter, active opponents have confessed their conversion on account of the war services of women. Already, three great provinces of Canada, Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchawan [sic], have given universal suffrage to their women in sheer generous appreciation of their war work. Even Mr. Asquith, world renowned for his immovable opposition to the Parliamentary suffrage for British women, has given evidence of a change of view. Some months ago, he announced his amazement at the utterly unexpected skill, strength and resource developed by the women and his gratitude for their loyalty and devotion. Later, in reply to Mrs. Henry Fawcett, who asked if woman suffrage would be included in a proposed election bill, he said that when the war should end, such a measure would be considered without prejudice carried over from events prior to the war. A public statement issued by Mr. Asquith in August, was couched in such terms as to be interpreted by many as a pledge to include women in the next election bill. In Great Britain, a sordid appeal which may prove the last straw to break the opposition to woman suffrage, has been added to the enthusiastic appreciation of woman's patriotism and practical service and to the sudden comprehension that motherhood is a national asset which must be protected at any price. A new voters' list is contemplated. A parliamentary election should be held in September but the voters are scattered far and wide. The whole nation is agitated over the questions involved in making a new register. At the same time, there is a constant anxiety over war funds, as is prudent in a nation spending 50 millions of dollars per day. It has been proposed that a large poll tax be assessed upon the voters of the new lists, whereupon a secondary proposal of great force has been offered and that is, that twice as much money would find its way into the public coffers were women added to the voters' list. What nation, with compliments fresh spoken concerning women's patriotism and efficiency, could resist such an appeal? So it happens that above the roar of cannon, the scream of shrapnel and the whirr of aeroplanes, one who listens may hear the cracking of the fetters which have long bound the European woman to outworn conventions. It has been a frightful price to pay but the fact remains that a womanhood, well started on the way to final emancipation, is destined to step forth from the war. It will be a bewildered, troubled and grief-stricken womanhood with knotty problems of life to solve, but it will be freer to deal with them than women have ever been before. ""The Woman's Hour has struck."" It has struck for the women of Europe and for those of all the world. The significance of the changed status of European women has not been lost upon the men and women of our land; our own people are not so unlearned in history, nor so lacking in National pride that they will allow the Republic to lag long behind the Empire, presided over by the descendant of George the Third. If they possess the patriotism and the sense of nationality which should be the inheritance of an American, they will not wait until the war is ended but will boldly lead in the inevitable march of democracy, our own American specialty. Sisters, let me repeat, the Woman's Hour has struck! Second, as the most adamantine rock gives way under the constant dripping of water, so the opposition to woman suffrage in our own country has slowly disintegrated before the increasing strength of our movement. Turn backward the pages of our history! Behold, brave Abbie Kelley rotten-egged because she, a woman, essayed to speak in public. Behold the Polish Ernestine Rose startled that women of free America drew aside their skirts when she proposed that they should control their own property. Recall the saintly Lucretia Mott and the legal-minded Elizabeth Cady Stanton, turned out of the World's Temperance convention in London and conspiring together to free their sex from the world's stupid oppressions. Remember the gentle, sweet-voiced Lucy Stone, egged because she publicly claimed that women had brains capable of education. Think upon Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, snubbed and boycotted by other women because she proposed to study medicine. Behold Dr. Antoinette Brown Blackwell, standing in sweet serenity before an Assembly of howling clergymen, angry that she, a woman dared to attend a Temperance Convention as a delegate. Revere the intrepid Susan B. Anthony mobbed from Buffalo to Albany because she demanded fair play for women. These are they who builded with others the foundation of political liberty for American women. Those who came after only laid the stones in place. Yet, what a wearisome task even that has been! Think of the wonderful woman who has wandered from village to village, from city to city, for a generation compelling men and women to listen and to reflect by her matchless eloquence. Where in all the world's history has any movement among men produced so invincible an advocate as our own Dr. Anna Howard Shaw? Those whom she has led to the light are Legion. Think, too, of the consecration, the self-denial, the never-failing constancy of that other noble soul set in a frail but unflinching body -- the heroine we know as Alice Stone Blackwell! A woman who never forgets, who detects the slightest flaw in the weapons of her adversary, who knows the most vulnerable spot in his armor, presides over the Woman's Journal and, like a lamp in a lighthouse, the rays of her intelligence, farsightedness and clear-thinking have enlightened the world concerning our cause. The names of hundreds of other brave souls spring to memory when we pause to review the long struggle. The hands of many suffrage master-masons have long been stilled; the names of many who laid the stones have been forgotten. That does not matter. The main thing is that the edifice of woman's liberty nears completion. It is strong, indestructible. All honor to the thousands who have helped in the building. The four Corner-stones of the foundations were laid long years ago. We read upon the first: ""We demand for women education, for not a high school or college is open to her""; upon the second, ""We demand for women religious liberty for in few churches is she permitted to pray or speak""; upon the third, ""We demand for women the right to own property and an opportunity to earn an honest living. Only six, poorly-paid occupations are open to her, and if she is married, the wages she earns are not hers""; upon the fourth, ""We demand political freedom and its symbol, the vote."" The stones in the foundation have long been overgrown with the moss and mould of time, and some there are who never knew they were laid. Of late, four cap-stones at the top have been set to match those in the base, and we read upon the first: ""The number of women who are graduated from high schools, colleges and universities is legion""; upon the second, ""The Christian Endeavor, that mighty, undenominational church militant, asks the vote for the women and the Methodist Episcopal Church, and many another, joins that appeal""; upon the third, ""Billions of dollars worth of property are earned and owned by women; more than 8 millions of women are wage-earners. Every occupation is open to them""; upon the fourth: ""Women vote in 12 States; they share in the determination of 91 electoral votes."" After the cap-stones and cornice comes the roof. Across the empty spaces, the rooftree has been flung and fastened well in place. It is not made of stone but of two planks -- planks in the platform of the two majority parties, and these are well supported by planks in the platforms of all minority parties. And we who are the builders of 1916, do we see a crisis? Standing upon these planks which are stretched across the top-most peak of this edifice of woman's liberty, what shall we do? Over our heads, up there in the clouds, but tantalizingly near, hangs the roof of our edifice -- the vote. What is our duty? Shall we spend time in admiring the capstones and cornice? Shall we lament the tragedies which accompanied the laying of the cornerstones? or, shall we, like the builders of old, chant, ""Ho! all hands, all hands, heave to! All hands, heave to!"" and while we chant, grasp the overhanging roof and with a long pull, a strong pull and a pull together, fix it in place forevermore? Is the crisis real or imaginary? If it be real, it calls for action, bold, immediate and decisive. Let us then take measure of our strength. Our cause has won the endorsement of all political parties. Every candidate for the presidency is a suffragist. It has won the endorsement of most churches; it has won the hearty approval of all great organizations of women. It was won the support of all reform movements; it has won the progressives of every variety. The majority of the press in most States is with us. Great men in every political party, church and movement are with us. The names of the greatest men and women of art, science, literature and philosophy, reform, religion and politics are on our lists. We have not won the reactionaries of any party, church or society, and we never will. From the beginning of things, there have been Antis. The Antis drove Moses out of Egypt; they crucified Christ who said, ""Love thy neighbor as thyself""; they have persecuted Jews in all parts of the world; they poisoned Socrates, the great philosopher; they cruelly persecuted Copernicus and Galileo, the first great scientists; they burned Giordano Bruno at the stake because he believed the world was round; they burned Savonarola who warred upon church corruption; they burned Eufame McIlyane because she used an anaesthetic; they burned Joan d'Arc for a heretic; they have sent great men and women to Siberia to eat their hearts out in isolation; they burned in effigy William Lloyd Garrison; they egged Abbie Kelley and Lucy Stone and mobbed Susan B. Anthony. Yet, in proportion to the enlightenment of their respective ages, these Antis were persons of intelligence and honest purpose. They were merely deaf to the call of Progress and were enraged because the world insisted upon moving on. Antis male and female there still are and will be to the end of time. Give to them a prayer of forgiveness for they know not what they do; and prepare for the forward march. We have not won the ignorant and illiterate and we never can. They are too undeveloped mentally to understand that the institutions of today are not those of yesterday nor will be those of tomorrow. We have not won the forces of evil and we never will. Evil has ever been timorous and suspicious of all change. It is an instinctive act of self-preservation which makes it fear and consequently oppose votes for women. As the Hon. Champ Clark said the other day: ""Some good and intelligent people are opposed to woman suffrage; but all the ignorant and evil-minded are against it."" These three forces are the enemies of our cause. Before the vote is won, there must and will be a gigantic final conflict between the forces of progress, righteousness and democracy and the forces of ignorance, evil and reaction. That struggle may be postponed, but it cannot be evaded or avoided. There is no question as to which side will be the victor. Shall we play the coward, then, and leave the hard knocks for our daughters, or shall we throw ourselves into the fray, bare our own shoulders to the blows, and thus bequeath to them a politically liberated womanhood? We have taken note of our gains and of our resources! and they are all we could wish. Before the final struggle, we must take cognizance of our weaknesses. Are we prepared to grasp the victory? Alas, no! our movement is like a great Niagara with a vast volume of water tumbling over its ledge but turning no wheel. Our organized machinery is set for the propagandistic stage and not for the seizure of victory. Our supporters are spreading the argument for our cause; they feel no sense of responsibility for the realization of our hopes. Our movement lacks cohesion, organization, unity and consequent momentum. Behind us, in front of us, everywhere about us are suffragists -- millions of them, but inactive and silent. They have been ""agitated and educated"" and are with us in belief. There are thousands of women who have at one time or another been members of our organization but they have dropped out because, to them the movement seemed negative and pointless. Many have taken up other work whose results were more immediate. Philanthropy, charity, work for corrective laws of various kinds, temperance, relief for working women and numberless similar public services have called them. Others have turned to the pleasanter avenues of clubwork, art or literature. There are thousands of other women who have never learned of the earlier struggles of our movement. They found doors of opportunity open to them on every side. They found well-paid posts awaiting the qualified woman and they have availed themselves of all these blessings; almost without exception they believe in the vote but they feel neither gratitude to those who opened the doors through which they have entered to economic liberty nor any sense of obligation to open other doors for those who come after. There are still others who, timorously looking over their shoulders to see if any listeners be near, will tell us they hope we will win and win soon but they are too frightened of Mother Grundy to help. There are others too occupied with the small things of life to help. They say they could find time to vote but not to work for the vote. There are men, too, millions of them, waiting to be called. These men and women are our reserves. They are largely unorganized and untrained soldiers with little responsibility toward our movement. Yet these reserves must be mobilized. The final struggle needs their numbers and the momentum those numbers will bring. Were never another convert made, there are suffragists enough in this country, if combined, to make so irresistible a driving force that victory might be seized at once. How can it be done? By a simple change of mental attitude. If we are to seize the victory, that change must take place in this hall, here and now! The old belief, which has sustained suffragists in many an hour of discouragement, ""woman suffrage is bound to come,"" must give way to the new, ""The Woman's Hour has struck."" The long drawn out struggle, the cruel hostility which, for years was arrayed against our cause, have accustomed suffragists to the idea of indefinite postponement but eventual victory. The slogan of a movements sets its pace. The old one counseled patience; it said, there is plenty of time; it pardoned sloth and half-hearted effort. It set the pace of an educational campaign. The ""Woman's Hour has struck"" sets the pace of a crusade which will have its way. It says: ""Awake, arise, my sisters, let your hearts be filled with joy -- the time of victory is here. Onward March."" If you believe with me that a crisis has come to our movement -- if you believe that the time for final action is now, if you catch the rosy tints of the coming day, what does it mean to you? Does it not give you a thrill of exaltation; does the blood not course more quickly through your veins; does it not bring a new sense of freedom, of joy and of determination? Is it not true that you who wanted a little time ago to lay down the work because you were weary with long service, now, under the compelling influence of a changed mental attitude, are ready to go on until the vote is won. The change is one of spirit! Aye, and the spiritual effect upon you will come to others. Let me borrow an expression from Honorable John Finlay: What our great movement needs now is a ""mobilization of spirit"" -- the jubilant, glad spirit of victory. Then let us sound a bugle call here and now to the women of the Nation: ""The Woman's Hour has struck."" Let the bugle sound from the suffrage headquarters of every State at the inauguration of a State campaign. Let the call go forth again and, again and yet again. Let it be repeated in every article written, in every speech made, in every conversation held. Let the bugle blow again and yet again. The Political emancipation of our sex calls you: Women of America, arise! Are you content that others shall pay the price of your liberty? Women in schools and counting house, in shops and on the farm, women in the home with babes at their breasts and women engaged in public careers will hear. The veins of American women are not filled with milk and water. They are neither cowards nor slackers. They will come. They only await the bugle call to learn that the final battle is on.  "
Opening Statement to Senate Judiciary Committee on the USSC Nomination of Clarence Thomas,Anita Hill,1991,"Ms. Hill: Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, members of the committee: My name is Anita F. Hill, and I am a professor of law at the University of Oklahoma. I was born on a farm in Okmulgee County, Oklahoma, in 1956. I am the youngest of 13 children. I had my early education in Okmulgee County. My father, Albert Hill, is a farmer in that area. My mother's name is Irma Hill. She is also a farmer and a housewife. My childhood was one of a lot of hard work and not much money, but it was one of solid family affection, as represented by my parents. I was reared in a religious atmosphere in the Baptist faith, and I have been a member of the Antioch Baptist Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma, since 1983. It is a very warm part of my life at the present time. For my undergraduate work, I went to Oklahoma State University and graduated from there in 1977. I am attaching to this statement a copy of my resume for further details of my education. Senator Biden: It will be included in the record as if read. Ms. Hill: Thank you. I graduated from the university with academic honors and proceeded to the Yale Law School, where I received my JD degree in 1980. Upon graduation from law school, I became a practicing lawyer with the Washington, DC, firm of Ward, Hardraker, and Ross. In 1981, I was introduced to now Judge Thomas by a mutual friend. Judge Thomas told me that he was anticipating a political appointment, and he asked if I would be interested in working with him. He was, in fact, appointed as Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights. After he was -- After he had taken that post, he asked if I would become his assistant, and I accepted that position. In my early period there, I had two major projects. The first was an article I wrote for Judge Thomas's signature on the education of minority students. The second was the organization of a seminar on high-risk students which was abandoned because Judge Thomas transferred to theEEOC where he became the chairman of that office. During this period at the Department of Education, my working relationship with Judge Thomas was positive. I had a good deal of responsibility and independence. I thought he respected my work and that he trusted my judgment. After approximately three months of working there, he asked me to go out socially with him. What happened next and telling the world about it are the two most difficult things -- experiences of my life. It is only after a great deal of agonizing consideration and sleepless number -- a great number of sleepless nights that I am able to talk of these unpleasant matters to anyone but my close friends. I declined the invitation to go out socially with him and explained to him that I thought it would jeopardize at what -- at -- at the time I considered to be a very good working relationship. I had a normal social life with other men outside of the office. I believed then, as now, that having a social relationship with a person who was supervising my work would be ill-advised. I was very uncomfortable with the idea and told him so. I thought that by saying no and explaining my reasons my employer would abandon his social suggestions. However, to my regret, in the following few weeks, he continued to ask me out on several occasions. He pressed me to justify my reasons for saying no to him. These incidents took place in his office or mine. They were in the form of private conversations which not -- would not have been overheard by anyone else. My working relationship became even more strained when Judge Thomas began to use work situations to discuss sex. On these occasions, he would call me into his office for reports on education issues and projects, or he might suggest that, because of the time pressures of his schedule, we go to lunch to a government cafeteria. After a brief discussion of work, he would turn the conversation to a discussion of sexual matters. His conversations were very vivid. He spoke about acts that he had seen in pornographic films involving such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes. He talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or large breasts involved in various sex acts. On several occasions, Thomas told me graphically of his own sexual prowess. Because I was extremely uncomfortable talking about sex with him at all, and particularly in such a graphic way, I told him that I did not want to talk about these subjects. I would also try to change the subject to education matters or to nonsexual personal matters such as his background or his beliefs. My efforts to change the -- the subject were rarely successful. Throughout the period of these conversations, he also, from time to time, asked me for social engagements. My reaction to these conversations was to avoid them by eliminating opportunities for us to engage in extended conversations. This was difficult because at the time I was his only assistant at the Office of Education -- or Office for Civil Rights. During the latter part of my time at the Department of Education, the social pressures and any conversation of his offensive behavior ended. I began both to believe and hope that our working relationship could be a proper, cordial, and professional one. When Judge Thomas was made chair of the EEOC, I needed to face the question of whether to go with him. I was asked to do so, and I did. The work itself was interesting, and at that time it appeared that the sexual overtures which had so troubled me had ended. I also faced the realistic fact that I had no alternative job. While I might have gone back to private practice, perhaps in my old firm or at another, I was dedicated to civil rights work, and my first choice was to be in that field. Moreover, the Department of Education itself was a dubious venture. President Reagan was seeking to abolish the entire department. For my first months at the EEOC, where I continued to be an assistant to Judge Thomas, there were no sexual conversations or overtures. However, during the fall and winter of 1982, these began again. The comments were random and ranged from pressing me about why I didn't go out with him to remarks about my personal appearance. I remember his saying that some day I would have to tell him the real reason that I wouldn't go out with him. He began to show displeasure in his tone and voice and his demeanor and his continued pressure for an explanation. He commented on what I was wearing in terms of whether it made me more or less sexually attractive. The incidents occurred in his inner office at the EEOC. One of the oddest episodes I remember was an occasion in which Thomas was drinking a Coke in his office. He got up from the table at which we were working, went over to his desk to get the Coke, looked at the can and asked, ""Who has pubic hair on my Coke?"" On other occasions, he referred to the size of his own penis as being larger than normal, and he also spoke on some occasions of the pleasures he had given to women with oral sex. At this point, late 1982, I began to feel severe stress on the job. I began to be concerned that Clarence Thomas might take out his anger with me by degrading me or not giving me important assignments. I also thought that he might find an excuse for dismissing me. In January of 1983, I began looking for another job. I was handicapped because I feared that, if he found out, he might make it difficult for me to find other employment and I might be dismissed from the job I had. Another factor that made my search more difficult was that there was a period -- this was during a period of a hiring freeze in the government. In February 1983, I was hospitalized for five days on an emergency basis for an acute -- for acute stomach pain, which I attributed to stress on the job. Once out of the hospital, I became more committed to find other employment and sought further to minimize my contact with Thomas. This became easier when Allison Duncan  became office director, because most of my work was then funneled through her and I had contact with Clarence Thomas mostly in staff meetings. In the spring of 1983, an opportunity to teach at Oral Roberts University opened up. I participated in a seminar -- taught an afternoon session and seminar at Oral Roberts University. The dean of the -- of the university saw me teaching and inquired as to whether I would be interested in furthering -- pursuing a career in teaching, beginning at Oral Roberts University. I agreed to take the job in large part because of my desire to escape the pressures I felt at the EEOC, due to Judge Thomas. When I informed him that I was leaving in July, I recall that his response was that now I would no longer have an excuse for not going out with him. I told him that I still preferred not to do so. At some time after that meeting, he asked if he could take me to dinner at the end of the term. When I declined, he assured me that the dinner was a professional courtesy only and not a social invitation. I reluctantly agreed to accept that invitation, but only if it was at the very end of a working day. On, as I recall, the last day of my employment at the EEOC in the summer of 1983, I did have dinner with Clarence Thomas. We went directly from work to a restaurant near the office. We talked about the work I had done, both at Education and at the EEOC. He told me that he was pleased with all of it except for an article and speech that I had done for him while we were at the Office for Civil Rights. Finally, he made a comment that I will vividly remember. He said that if I ever told anyone of his behavior that it would ruin his career. This was not an apology, nor was it an explanation. That was his last remark about the possibility of our going out or reference to his behavior. In July of 1983, I left Washington, D.C. area and I've had minimal contacts with Judge Clarence Thomas since. I am of course aware from the Press that some questions have been raised about conversations I had with Judge Clarence Thomas after I left the EEOC. From 1983 until today, I have seen Judge Thomas only twice. On one occasion, I needed to get a reference from him, and on another he made a public appearance in Tulsa. On one occasion he called me at home and we had an inconsequential conversation. On one occasion he called me without reaching me, and I returned the call without reaching him, and nothing came of it. I have, on at least three occasions, been asked to [act] as a conduit to him for others. I knew his secretary, Diane Holt. We had worked together at both EEOC and Education. There were occasions on which I spoke to her, and on some of these occasions undoubtedly I passed on some casual comment to then Chairman Thomas. There were a series of calls in the first three months of 1985, occasioned by a group in Tulsa, which wished to have a civil rights conference. They wanted Judge Thomas to be the speaker and enlisted my assistance for this purpose. I did call in January and February to no effect, and finally suggested to the person directly involved, Susan Cahall, that she put the -- that she put the matter into her own hands and call directly. She did so in March of 1985. In connection with that March invitation, Ms. Cahall wanted conference materials for the seminar and some research was needed. I was asked to try to get the information and did attempt to do so. There was another call about another possible conference in the July of 1985. In August of 1987, I was in Washington, D.C. and I did call Diane Holt. In the course of this conversation, she asked me how long I was going to be in town and I told her. It is recorded in the message as August 15. It was, in fact, August 20th. She told me about Judge Thomas's marriage and I did say, ""Congratulate him."" It is only after a great deal of agonizing consideration that I am able to talk of these unpleasant matters to anyone except my closest friends. As I've said before these last few days have been very trying and very hard for me, and it hasn't just been the last few days this week. It has actually been over a month now that I have been under the strain of this issue. Telling the world is the most difficult experience of my life, but it is very close to having to live through the experience that occasion this meeting. I may have used poor judgment early on in my relationship with this issue. I was aware, however, that telling at any point in my career could adversely affect my future career. And I did not want early on to burn all the bridges to the EEOC. As I said, I may have used poor judgment. Perhaps I should have taken angry or even militant steps, both when I was in the agency, or after I left it. But I must confess to the world that the course that I took seemed the better as well as the easier approach. I declined any comment to newspapers, but later when Senate staff asked me about these matters I felt I had a duty to report. I have no personal vendetta against Clarence Thomas. I seek only to provide the committee with information which it may regard as relevant. It would have been more comfortable to remain silent. It took no initiative to inform anyone -- I took no initiative to inform anyone. But when I was asked by a representative of this committee to report my experience, I felt that I had to tell the truth. I could not keep silent.  "
Address to Congress on Womens Suffrage,Carrie Chapman Catt,1917,"Woman suffrage is inevitable. Suffragists knew it before November 4, 1917; opponents afterward. Three distinct causes made it inevitable. First, the history of our country. Ours is a nation born of revolution, of rebellion against a system of government so securely entrenched in the customs and traditions of human society that in 1776 it seemed impregnable. From the beginning of things, nations had been ruled by kings and for kings, while the people served and paid the cost. The American Revolutionists boldly proclaimed the heresies: ""Taxation without representation is tyranny."" ""Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed."" The colonists won, and the nation which was established as a result of their victory has held unfailingly that these two fundamental principles of democratic government are not only the spiritual source of our national existence but have been our chief historic pride and at all times the sheet anchor of our liberties. Eighty years after the Revolution, Abraham Lincoln welded those two maxims into a new one: ""Ours is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people."" Fifty years more passed and the president of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, in a mighty crisis of the nation, proclaimed to the world: ""We are fighting for the things which we have always carried nearest to our hearts: for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government."" All the way between these immortal aphorisms political leaders have declared unabated faith in their truth. Not one American has arisen to question their logic in the 141 years of our national existence. However stupidly our country may have evaded the logical application at times, it has never swerved from its devotion to the theory of democracy as expressed by those two axioms... With such a history behind it, how can our nation escape the logic it has never failed to follow, when its last un-enfranchised class calls for the vote? Behold our Uncle Sam floating the banner with one hand, ""Taxation without representation is tyranny,"" and with the other seizing the billions of dollars paid in taxes by women to whom he refuses ""representation."" Behold him again, welcoming the boys of twenty-one and the newly made immigrant citizen to ""a voice in their own government"" while he denies that fundamental right of democracy to thousands of women public school teachers from whom many of these men learn all they know of citizenship and patriotism, to women college presidents, to women who preach in our pulpits, interpret law in our courts, preside over our hospitals, write books and magazines, and serve in every uplifting moral and social enterprise. Is there a single man who can justify such inequality of treatment, such outrageous discrimination? Not one... Second, the suffrage for women already established in the United States makes women suffrage for the nation inevitable. When Elihu Root, as president of the American Society of International Law, at the eleventh annual meeting in Washington, April 26, 1917, said, ""The world cannot be half democratic and half autocratic. It must be all democratic or all Prussian. There can be no compromise,"" he voiced a general truth. Precisely the same intuition has already taught the blindest and most hostile foe of woman suffrage that our nation cannot long continue a condition under which government in half its territory rests upon the consent of half of the people and in the other half upon the consent of all the people; a condition which grants representation to the taxed in half of its territory and denies it in the other half a condition which permits women in some states to share in the election of the president, senators, and representatives and denies them that privilege in others. It is too obvious to require demonstration that woman suffrage, now covering half our territory, will eventually be ordained in all the nation. No one will deny it. The only question left is when and how will it be completely established. Third, the leadership of the United States in world democracy compels the enfranchisement of its own women. The maxims of the Declaration were once called ""fundamental principles of government."" They are now called ""American principles"" or even ""Americanisms."" They have become the slogans of every movement toward political liberty the world around, of every effort to widen the suffrage for men or women in any land. Not a people, race, or class striving for freedom is there anywhere in the world that has not made our axioms the chief weapon of the struggle. More, all men and women the world around, with farsighted vision into the verities of things, know that the world tragedy of our day is not now being waged over the assassination of an archduke, nor commercial competition, nor national ambitions, nor the freedom of the seas. It is a death grapple between the forces which deny and those which uphold the truths of the Declaration of Independence... Do you realize that in no other country in the world with democratic tendencies is suffrage so completely denied as in a considerable number of our own states? There are thirteen black states where no suffrage for women exists, and fourteen others where suffrage for women is more limited than in many foreign countries. Do you realize that when you ask women to take their cause to state referendum you compel them to do this: that you drive women of education, refinement, achievement, to beg men who cannot read for their political freedom? Do you realize that such anomalies as a college president asking her janitor to give her a vote are overstraining the patience and driving women to desperation? Do you realize that women in increasing numbers indignantly resent the long delay in their enfranchisement? Your party platforms have pledged women suffrage. Then why not be honest, frank friends of our cause, adopt it in reality as your own, make it a party program, and ""fight with us""? As a party measure -- a measure of all parties -- why not put the amendment through Congress and the legislatures? We shall all be better friends, we shall have a happier nation, we women will be free to support loyally the party of our choice, and we shall be far prouder of our history. ""There is one thing mightier than kings and armies"" -- aye, than Congresses and political parties -- ""the power of an idea when its time has come to move."" The time for woman suffrage has come. The woman's hour has struck. If parties prefer to postpone action longer and thus do battle with this idea, they challenge the inevitable. The idea will not perish; the party which opposes it may. Every delay, every trick, every political dishonesty from now on will antagonize the women of the land more and more, and when the party or parties which have so delayed woman suffrage finally let it come, their sincerity will be doubted and their appeal to the new voters will be met with suspicion. This is the psychology of the situation. Can you afford the risk? Think it over. We know you will meet opposition. There are a few ""women haters"" left, a few ""old males of the tribe,"" as Vance Thompson calls them, whose duty they believe it to be to keep women in the places they have carefully picked out for them. Treitschke, made world famous by war literature, said some years ago, ""Germany, which knows all about Germany and France, knows far better what is good for Alsace-Lorraine than that miserable people can possibly know."" A few American Treitschkes we have who know better than women what is good for them. There are women, too, with ""slave souls"" and ""clinging vines"" for backbones. There are female dolls and male dandies. But the world does not wait for such as these, nor does liberty pause to heed the plaint of men and women with a grouch. She does not wait for those who have a special interest to serve, nor a selfish reason for depriving other people of freedom. Holding her torch aloft, liberty is pointing the way onward and upward and saying to America, ""Come."" To you and the supporters of our cause in Senate and House, and the number is large, the suffragists of the nation express their grateful thanks. This address is not meant for you. We are more truly appreciative of all you have done than any words can express. We ask you to make a last, hard fight for the amendment during the present session. Since last we asked a vote on this amendment, your position has been fortified by the addition to suffrage territory of Great Britain, Canada, and New York. Some of you have been too indifferent to give more than casual attention to this question. It is worthy of your immediate consideration. A question big enough to engage the attention of our allies in wartime is too big a question for you to neglect. Some of you have grown old in party service. Are you willing that those who take your places by and by shall blame you for having failed to keep pace with the world and thus having lost for them a party advantage? Is there any real gain for you, for your party, for your nation by delay? Do you want to drive the progressive men and women out of your party? Some of you hold to the doctrine of states' rights as applying to woman suffrage. Adherence to that theory will keep the United States far behind all other democratic nations upon this question. A theory which prevents a nation from keeping up with the trend of world progress cannot be justified. Gentlemen, we hereby petition you, our only designated representatives, to redress our grievances by the immediate passage of the Federal Suffrage Amendment and to use your influence to secure its ratification in your own state, in order that the women of our nation may be endowed with political freedom before the next presidential election, and that our nation may resume its world leadership in democracy. Woman suffrage is coming -- you know it. Will you, Honorable Senators and Members of the House of Representatives, help or hinder it?  "
 1992 Democratic National Convention Address,Elizabeth Glaser,1992,"I'm Elizabeth Glaser. Eleven years ago, while giving birth to myfirst child, I hemorrhaged and was transfused with seven pints of blood. Four years later,I found out that I had been infected with the AIDS virus and had unknowingly passed it to my daughter, Ariel, through my breast milk, and my son, Jake, in utero. Twenty years ago I wanted to be at the Democratic Convention becauseit was a way to participate in my country. Today, I am here because it's a matter of lifeand death. Exactly -- Exactly four years ago my daughter died of AIDS. She did not survive the ReaganAdministration. I am here because my son and I may not survive four more years of leaderswho say they care, but do nothing. I -- I am in a race with the clock. This is not about beinga Republican or an Independent or a Democrat. It's about the future -- for each and everyone of us. I started out just a mom -- fighting for the life of her child. Butalong the way I learned how unfair America can be today, not just for people who have HIV,but for many, many people -- poor people, gay people, people of color, children. A strange spokespersonfor such a group: a well-to-do white woman. But I have learned my lesson the hard way,and I know that America has lost her path and is at risk of losing her soul. America wakeup: We are all in a struggle between life and death. I understand -- I understand the sense of frustration and despair in our country,because I know firsthand about shouting for help and getting no answer. I went toWashington to tell Presidents Reagan and Bush that much, much more had to be done for AIDS research and care, and that children couldn't be forgotten. The first time, when nothing happened, I thought, ""They just didn't hear me."" The second time, when nothing happened, Ithought, ""Maybe I didn't shout loud enough."" But now I realize they don't hear becausethey don't want to listen. When you cry for help and no one listens, you start to loseyour hope. I began to lose faith in America. I felt my country was lettingme down -- and it was. This is not the America I was raised to be proud of. I was raised tobelieve that other's problems were my problems as well. But when I tell most people aboutHIV, in hopes that they will help and care, I see the look in their eyes: ""It's not myproblem,"" they're thinking. Well, it's everyone's problem and we need a leader who will tellus that. We need a visionary to guide us -- to say it wasn't all right for Ryan White to be banned from school because he had AIDS, to say it wasn't alright for a man or a woman to be denied a job becausethey're infected with this virus. We need a leader who is truly committed to educatingus. I believe in America, but not with a leadership of selfishness andgreed -- where the wealthy get health care and insurance and the poor don't. Do you know -- Do you know howmuch my AIDS care costs? Over 40,000 dollars a year. Someone without insurance can't affordthis. Even the drugs that I hope will keep me alive are out of reach for others. Is theirlife any less valuable? Of course not. This is not the America I was raised to be proudof -- where rich people get care and drugs that poor people can't. We need health carefor all. We need a leader who will say this and do something about it. I believe in America, but not a leadership that talks aboutproblems but is incapable of solving them -- two HIV commission reports with recommendationsabout what to do to solve this crisis sitting on shelves, gathering dust. We need aleader who will not only listen to these recommendations, but implement them. I believe in America, but not with a leadership that doesn't holdgovernment accountable. I go to Washington to the National Institutes of Health and say,""Show me what you're doing on HIV."" They hate it when I come because I try totell them how to do it better. But that's why I love being a taxpayer, because it's mymoney and they must feel accountable. I believe in an America where our leaders talk straight. When anyonetells President Bush that the battle against AIDS is seriously under-funded, he jugglesthe numbers to mislead the public into thinking we're spending twice as much as we reallyare. While they play games with numbers, people are dying. I believe in America, but an America where there is a light in everyhome. A thousand points of light just wasn't enough: My house has been dark for toolong. Once every generation, history brings us to an important crossroads.Sometimes in life there is that moment when it's possible to make a change for the better.This is one of those moments. For me, this is not politics. This is a crisis of caring. In this hall is the future -- women, men of all colors saying, ""TakeAmerica back."" We are -- We are just real people wanting a more hopeful life. But words and ideas arenot enough. Good thoughts won't save my family. What's the point of caring if we don't dosomething about it? A President and a Congress that can work togetherso we can get out of this gridlock and move ahead, because I don't win my war if the President cares and the Congress doesn't, or if the Congress cares and the President doesn't support the ideas. The people in this hall this week, the Democratic Party, all of uscan begin to deliver that partnership, and in November we can all bring it home. My daughter lived seven years, and in her last year, when shecouldn't walk or talk, her wisdom shone through. She taught me to love, when all Iwanted to do was hate. She taught me to help others, when all I wanted to do was helpmyself. She taught me to be brave, when all I felt was fear. My daughter and I lovedeach other with simplicity. America, we can do the same. This was the country that offered hope. This was the place wheredreams could come true, not just economic dreams, but dreams of freedom, justice, andequality. We all need to hope that our dreams can come true. I challenge you to make ithappen, because all our lives, not just mine, depend on it. Thank you."
The Childrens Era Speech,Margaret Sanger,1925,"Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: My subject is ""The Children's Era."" The Children's Era! This makes me think of Ellen Key's book -- The Century of the Child. Ellen Key hoped that this twentieth century was to be the century of the child.  The twentieth century, she said, would see this old world of ours converted into a beautiful garden of children. Well, we have already lived through a quarter of this twentieth century. What steps have we taken toward making it the century of the child? So far, very, very few. Why does the  Children's Era still remain a dream of the dim and the distant future? Why has so little been accomplished? -- in spite of all our acknowledged love of children, all our generosity, all our good-will, all the enormous spending of millions on philanthropy and charities, all our warm-hearted sentiment, all our incessant activity and social consciousness? Why? Before you can cultivate a garden, you must know something about gardening. You have got to give your seeds a proper soil in which to grow. You have got to give them sunlight and fresh air. You have got to give them space and the opportunity (if they are to lift their flowers to the sun), to strike their roots deep into that soil. And always -- do not forget this -- you have got to fight weeds. You cannot have a garden, if you let weeds overrun it. So, if we want to make this world a garden for children, we must first of all learn the lesson of the gardener. So far we have not been gardeners. We have only been a sort of silly reception committee, a reception committee at the Grand Central Station of life. Trainload after trainload of children are coming in, day and night -- nameless refugees arriving out of the Nowhere into the Here. Trainload after trainload -- many unwelcome, unwanted, unprepared for, unknown, without baggage, without passports, most of them without pedigrees. These unlimited hordes of refugees arrive in such numbers that the reception committee is thrown into a panic -- a panic of activity. The reception committee arouses itself heroically, establishes emergency measures: milk stations, maternity centers, settlement houses, playgrounds, orphanages, welfare leagues, and every conceivable kind of charitable effort. But still trainloads of children keep on coming -- human weed crop up that spread so fast in this sinister struggle for existence, that the overworked committee becomes exhausted, inefficient, and can think of no way out. When we protest against this immeasurable, meaningless waste of motherhood and child-life; when we protest against the ever-mounting cost to the world of asylums, prisons, homes for the feeble-minded, and such institutions for the unfit, when we protest against the disorder and chaos and tragedy of modern life, when we point out the biological corruption that is destroying the very heart of American life, we are told that we are making merely an ""emotional"" appeal. When we point the one immediate practical way toward order and beauty in society, the only way to lay the foundations of a society composed of happy children, happy women, and happy men, they call this idea indecent and immoral. It is not enough to clean up the filth and disorder of our overcrowded cities. It is not enough to stop the evil of Child Labor -- even if we could! It is not enough to decrease the rate of infantile mortality. It is not enough to open playgrounds, and build more public schools in which we can standardize the mind of the young. It is not enough to throw millions upon millions of dollars into charities and philanthropies. Don't deceive ourselves that by so doing we are making the world ""Safe for Children."" Those of you who have followed the sessions of this Conference must, I am sure, agree with me that the first real stop toward the creation of a Children's Era must lie in providing the conditions of healthy life for children not only before birth but even more imperatively before conception. Human society must protect its children -- yes, but prenatal care is most essential! The child-to-be, as yet not called into being, has rights no less imperative. We have learned in the preceding sessions of this Conference that, if we wish to produce strong and sturdy children, the embryo must grow in a chemically healthy medium. The blood stream of the mother must be chemically normal. Worry, strain, shock, unhappiness, enforced maternity, may all poison the blood of the enslaved mother. This chemically poisoned blood may produce a defective baby -- a child foredoomed to idiocy, or feeble-mindedness, crime, or failure. Do I exaggerate? Am I taking a rare exception and making it a general rule? Our opponents declare that children are conceived in love, and that every new-born baby converts its parents to love and unselfishness. My answer is to point to the asylums, the hospitals, the ever-growing institutions for the unfit. Look into the family history of those who are feeble-minded; or behind the bars of jails and prisons. Trace the family histories; find out the conditions under which they were conceived and born, before you attempt to persuade us that reckless breeding has nothing to do with these grave questions. There is only one way out. We have got to fight for the health and happiness of the Unborn Child. And to do that in a practical, tangible way, we have got to free women from enforced, enslaved maternity. There can be no hope for the future of civilization, no certainty of racial salvation, until every woman can decide for herself whether she will or will not become a mother, and when and how many children she cares to bring into the world. That is the first step. I would like to suggest Civil Service examinations for parenthood! Prospective parents after such an examination would be given a parenthood license, proving that they are physically and mentally fit to be the fathers and mothers of the next generation. This is an interesting idea -- but then arises the questions ""Who is to decide?"" ""Would there be a jury, like a play jury?"" Would a Republican administration give parenthood permits only to Republicans -- or perhaps only to Democrats? The more you think of governmental interference, the less it works out. Take this plan of civil service examination for parenthood. It suggests Prohibition: there might even be bootlegging in babies! No, I doubt the advisability of governmental sanction.  The problem of bringing children into the world ought to be decided by those most seriously involved -- those who run the greatest risks; in the last analysis -- by the mother and the child. If there is going to be any Civil Service examination, let it be conducted by the Unborn Child, the Child-to-be. Just try for a moment to picture the possibilities of such an examination. When you want a cook or housemaid, you go to an employment bureau. You have to answer questions. You have to exchange references. You have to persuade the talented cook that you conduct a proper well-run household. Children ought to have at least the same privilege as cooks. Sometimes in idle moments I like to think it would be a very good scheme to have a bureau of the Child-to-be. At such a bureau of the unborn, the wise child might be able to find out a few things about its father -- and its mother. Just think for a moment of this bureau where prospective parents might apply for a baby. Think of the questions they would be asked by the agent of the unborn or by the baby itself. First: ""Mr. Father, a baby is an expensive luxury. Can you really afford one?"" ""Have you paid for your last baby yet?"" ""How many children have you already? Six? You must have your hands full. Can you take care of so many?"" ""Do you look upon children as a reward -- or a penalty?"" ""How are you ductless glands -- well balanced?"" Can you provide a happy home for one! A sunny nursery? Proper food?"" ""What's that you say? Ten children already? Two dark rooms in the slums?"" ""No, thank you! I don't care to be born at all if I cannot be well-born. Good-bye!"" And if we could organize a society for the prevention of cruelty to unborn children, we would make it a law that children should be brought into the world only when they were welcome, invited, and wanted; that they would arrive with a clean bill of health and heritage; that they would possess healthy, happy, well-mated, and mature parents. And there would be certain conditions of circumstances which would preclude parenthood. These conditions, the presence of which would make parenthood a crime, are the following: 1. Transmissible disease 2. Temporary disease 3. Subnormal children already in the family 4. Space out between births 5. Twenty-three years as a minimum age for parents 6. Economic circumstances adequate 7. Spiritual harmony between parents. In conclusion, let me repeat: We are not trying to establish a dictatorship over parents. We want to free women from enslavery and unwilling  motherhood. We are fighting for the emancipation for the mothers of the world, of the children of the world, and the children to be. We want to create a real Century of the Child -- usher in a Children's Era. We can do this by handling the terrific gift of life in bodies fit and perfect as can be fashioned. Help us to make this Conference, which as aroused so much interest, the turning point toward this era. Only so can you help in the creation of the future."
A LeftHanded Commencement Address,Ursula K. Le Guin,1983,"I want to thank the Mills College Class of '83 for offering me a rare chance: to speak aloud in public in the language of women. I know there are men graduating, and I don't mean to exclude them, far from it. There is a Greek tragedy where the Greek says to the foreigner, If you don't understand Greek, please signify by nodding. Anyhow, commencements are usually operated under the unspoken agreement that everybody graduating is either male or ought to be. Thats why we are all wearing these twelfth-century dresses that look so great on men and make women look either like a mushroom or a pregnant stork. Intellectual tradition is male. Public speaking is done in the public tongue, the national or tribal language; and the language of our tribe is the men's language. Of course women learn it. We're not dumb. If you can tell Margaret Thatcher from Ronald Reagan, or Indira Gandhi from General Somoza, by anything they say, tell me how. This is a mans world, so it talks a mans language. The words are all words of power. Youve come a long way, baby, but no way is long enough. You cant even get there by selling yourself out: because there is theirs, not yours. Maybe weve had enough words of power and talk about the battle of life. Maybe we need some words of weakness. Instead of saying now that I hope you will all go forth from this ivory tower of college into the Real World and forge a triumphant career or at least help your husband to and keep our country strong and be a success in everything -- instead of talking about power, what if I talked like a woman right here in public? It wont sound right. Its going to sound terrible. What if I said what I hope for you is first, if -- only if -- you want kids, I hope you have them. Not hordes of them. A couple, enough. I hope theyre beautiful. I hope you and they have enough to eat, and a place to be warm and clean in, and friends, and work you like doing. Well, is that what you went to college for? Is that all? What about success? Success is somebody elses failure. Success is the American Dream we can keep dreaming because most people in most places, including thirty million of ourselves, live wide awake in the terrible reality of poverty. No, I do not wish you success. I dont even want to talk about it. I want to talk about failure. Because you are human beings you are going to meet failure. You are going to meet disappointment, injustice, betrayal, and irreparable loss. You will find youre weak where you thought yourself strong. Youll work for possessions and then find they possess you. You will find yourself -- as I know you already have -- in dark places, alone, and afraid. What I hope for you, for all my sisters and daughters, brothers and sons, is that you will be able to live there, in the dark place. To live in the place that our rationalizing culture of success denies, calling it a place of exile, uninhabitable, foreign. Well, were already foreigners. Women as women are largely excluded from, alien to, the self-declared male norms of this society, where human beings are called Man, the only respectable god is male, the only direction is up. So thats their country; lets explore our own. Im not talking about sex; thats a whole other universe, where every man and woman is on their own. Im talking about society, the so-called mans world of institutionalized competition, aggression, violence, authority, and power. If we want to live as women, some separatism is forced upon us: Mills College is a wise embodiment of that separatism. The war-games world wasnt made by us or for us; we cant even breathe the air there without masks. And if you put the mask on youll have a hard time getting it off. So how about going on doing things our own way, as to some extent you did here at Mills? Not for men and the male power hierarchy -- thats their game. Not against men, either -- thats still playing by their rules. But with any men who are with us: thats our game. Why should a free woman with a college education either fight Machoman or serve him? Why should she live her life on his terms? Machoman is afraid of our terms, which are not all rational, positive, competitive, etc. And so he has taught us to despise and deny them. In our society, women have lived, and have been despised for living, the whole side of life that includes and takes responsibility for helplessness, weakness, and illness, for the irrational and the irreparable, for all that is obscure, passive, uncontrolled, animal, unclean -- the valley of the shadow, the deep, the depths of life. All that the Warrior denies and refuses is left to us and the men who share it with us and therefore, like us, cant play doctor, only nurse, cant be warriors, only civilians, cant be chiefs, only indians. Well so that is our country. The night side of our country. If there is a day side to it, high sierras, prairies of bright grass, we only know pioneers tales about it, we havent got there yet. Were never going to get there by imitating Machoman. We are only going to get there by going our own way, by living there, by living through the night in our own country. So what I hope for you is that you live there not as prisoners, ashamed of being women, consenting captives of a psychopathic social system, but as natives. That you will be at home there, keep house there, be your own mistress, with a room of your own. That you will do your work there, whatever youre good at, art or science or tech or running a company or sweeping under the beds, and when they tell you that its second-class work because a woman is doing it, I hope you tell them to go to hell and while theyre going to give you equal pay for equal time. I hope you live without the need to dominate, and without the need to be dominated. I hope you are never victims, but I hope you have no power over other people. And when you fail, and are defeated, and in pain, and in the dark, then I hope you will remember that darkness is your country, where you live, where no wars are fought and no wars are won, but where the future is. Our roots are in the dark; the earth is our country. Why did we look up for blessing -- instead of around, and down? What hope we have lies there. Not in the sky full of orbiting spy-eyes and weaponry, but in the earth we have looked down upon. Not from above, but from below. Not in the light that blinds, but in the dark that nourishes, where human beings grow human souls."
 Statement at the Smith Act Trial,Elizabeth Gurley Flynn,1952,"Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen, myname is Elizabeth Gurley Flynn.  I am a defendant in this case, acting as my ownattorney, and therefore have the opportunity to address you directly.  It is unusualfor a defendant to represent one’s self, but my comrade, Mr. Pettis Perry and I haveelected to do so.  Neither of us is a lawyer.  We will speak to you in thelanguage of laymen and women, I should say. We are both Communist leaders, proudly and avowedly.  We arequalified to explain to you what the Communist Party of the U.S.A. really stands for, whatit advocates, what its day-by-day activities are, and what are its ultimate aims.  Wewill try to do so in simple, non-technical language.  We will prove to you that weare not a criminal conspiracy but a 33-year-old working class political party, devoted tothe immediate needs and aspirations of the American people, to the advancement of theworkers, farmers and the Negro people, to the preservation of the democracy and culture,and to the advocacy of Socialism. Our ideas may be new and strange to you.  Probably you havenever seen or met a Communist before.  We don’t ask you to agree with us but tolisten with an open mind and not to accept as gospel truth the sensational tales ofstool-pigeons and planted agents who will be the Government’s chief, if not sole,witnesses. Centuries ago, Judas became the symbol of such infamy, a forerunnerof those who join a group of sincere and honest people, advocate its teachings, carry outits practices only to betray it. *           *           *           *           *           *           * We will prove to you that we who stand ready tomake extreme sacrifices for what we believe, are giving you a true picture of the purposesof the Communist Party. It is customary for a client to be introduced to the jury byhis or her attorney.  I am my own attorney. I must therefore, introduce myself. I am an American of Irish decent.  My father, Thomas Flynn, was born in Maine. My mother, Anne Gurley, was born in Galway, Ireland.  I was born in Concord, NewHampshire, 62 years ago.  I married in 1908, separated from my husband shortlythereafter, and have always used my own name.  My only son, Fred, died in 1940 at theage of 29 from a chest cancer.  I reside with my sister, who is a retired schoolteacher.  We have lived in New York City for the past 52 years.  My mother was askilled tailoress; my father a quarry worker who worked his way through the engineeringschool at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.  My father, grandfather, and all myuncles were members of labor unions. *           *           *           *           *           *           * To continue, ladies and gentlemen, one of theessential issues in this case is my individual intent, the intent with which I joined theCommunist Party and have remained a member of it, and the intent with which I have triedto carry out its program. My intent has been shaped out of my earlier experiences and myreaction  to the conditions of life, especially the conditions of the worker. By showing you what my intent is and what in my life shaped theintent, I shall show you that never have I, and not now do I, intend to advocate theoverthrow of government by force and violence, nor do I intend to bring about suchoverthrow. I come from a family whose day-by-day diet included important socialissues of the day, and form this I early learned to question things as they are and toseek improvements. Thus, my mother advocated Women’s Suffrage, and my father andmother -- *           *           *           *           *           *           * -- and my father and mother discussed with theirchildren the campaigns of Debs, the Socialist candidate for President. My father read aloud to me and to my brother and sisters such booksas the Communist Manifesto and other writings of Marx and Engels, which the Governmentwill use as evidence in this trial. I was a serious child, due probably to these childishimpressions which are background to my affiliation in my extreme youth with the Socialistmovement and in my mature years with the Communist Party. Times were hard.  We were poor.  My first experience withdiscrimination was in Manchester, New Hampshire, when my father ran for city engineerabout 1895.  I heard it said he was defeated because he was Irish.  He was verybitter on this subject and told us of signs on factories when he was a boy, “No Irishneed apply.” Our parents opposed all forms of national, religious or colordiscrimination, which we will prove is identical with the position of the Communist Partytoday and form the basis of the position I take today in the Communist Party. My first knowledge of the meaning of imperialism, which will be anissue in this case, was a vivid recollection of my father’s opposition to theSpanish-American War and his insistence on the right of the Cuban and Philippine peoplesto their independence.  He joined an anti-imperialist league to protest against ourcountry embarking on the evil path of imperialism, which we will prove began at that time. The conditions in the textile towns of New Hampshire andMassachusetts contributed to my later joining the Communist Party, which, as Mr. Lanesays, concentrates on the recruiting of workers in industry: huge gray mills, likeprisons, barrack-like company boarding houses, long hours, low wages, long periods ofslack; the prosperous owner lived in the center of Adams, Massachusetts, and rode aroundin his fine carriage with its beautiful horses. I saw lard instead of butter onneighbors’ tables, children without underwear in cold New England winters, a girlscalped by an unguarded machine in a mill across the street from our school. I saw an oldman weeping as they put him in the lockup as a tramp. Then we came to live in the drab South Bronx, near the New HavenRailroad’s roundhouse, in a cold water, unheated, gas lit flat. Casualties andaccidents were high among the railroad workers.  Children were maimed as theygathered coal in the yards in bad times. My mother helped women in the neighborhoodwho could not afford a doctor when a baby came. *           *           *           *           *           *           * Yes, I was greatly troubled by all this.  Whydid good hard-working people suffer so?  Why were men who were willing, able, andanxious to work, denied jobs?  Why was there so much unemployment?  Why werethere rich people who apparently did little but enjoyed life?  I hated poverty. I saw my mother humiliated when unpaid grocery bills could not be met and the landlordstood at the door demanding his rent. *           *           *           *           *           *           * I joined a debating society in P.S. 9 in the lowerBronx.  I won a medal in a debate on the subject, “Should the Government own themines?”  I said, “Yes, it should.” This was during the great anthracite coal strike in 1902.  Iattended Bronx Socialist meeting in 1905; later at the Harlem Socialist Club at 125thStreet.  My speaking career started in 1906 on the ambitious subject of women undersocialism. Naturally, I drew heavily on authors, American women, like Charlotte Petingilland Susan B. Anthony, also on a book written in 1872 by Augustus Bebel, a Socialist memberof the German Reichstag, written while he was in prison under Bismarck’santi-Socialist law.  It was first published here by the Socialist Labor Party in1904.  I am puzzled to see it on the Government’s list of documents.  Whatrelation it has to this indictment is hard to fathom, unless to advocate the fullpolitical, economic, and social emancipation of women has become a form of advocacy of theoverthrow of government by force and violence under the Government’s interpretationof the Smith Act. But if this historic and economic study, which is very much out ofdate today, is to be finely tooth-combed for sentences which torn out of context candistort its meaning, this, we will prove, can be done to any book, no matter what itspurpose, even to the Bible, Shakespeare, or Gray’s Anatomy. My youthful ambition, believe it or not, was to be a constitutionallawyer.  Instead, I became a labor organizer.  Then it was call an agitator, or,by the press, one who stirred up the people.  I was determined to do something aboutthe bad conditions under which our family and all around us suffered.  I have stuckto that purpose for 46 years.  I consider in so doing I have been a goodAmerican.  I have spent my life among the American workers all over this country,slept in their homes, eaten at their tables.  They are the majority of the people whohave the inalienable right in our view to govern the country.  We mean by workers,all who do useful work of hand or brain.  My life work began when I joined theI.W.W., Industrial Workers of the World, in 1906, a pioneer in industrial unions whichflashed like a great comet across the horizon of the American labor movement for nearlytwo decades.  I returned as an I.W.W. organizer in 1912 to New England, mybirthplace, where the I.W.W. led historical textile strikes in Lawrence, Lowell, and NewBedford, Massachusetts.  The strikes were unorganized, largely foreign-born men andwomen whose wages were cut when their hours were reduced by Massachusetts law. *           *           *           *           *           *           * In 1913 I was a leader in the Paterson, New Jerseysilk strike; in 1916, in a strike of the iron ore miners on the Mesaba range in Minnesota,where the mines are owned by the U.S. Street trust, I will attempt to prove to you that itis not the Communists who advocate and use force and violence.  I saw it used in allof these labor struggles, not by the workers but by police, company guards and Statemilitia.  I saw workers clubbed, beaten and shot down. I spoke -- *           *           *           *           *           *           * My travels as a Communist speaker have taken meall over the country.  I saw the fruits of a lawless, aggressive, brutal and ruthlesscapitalism which garnered profits for a few at the expense of the many. Our country is a rich and beautiful country, fully capable ofproducing plenty for all, educating its youth and caring for its aged. We believe it coulddo this under Socialism. I saw great forests cut down and the denuded land left withblackened stumps; miles of top soil blown and washed away, and fertile fields became likea desert. I have seen textile workers who wove beautiful woolen fabricsshivering for lack of warm clothing, and coal miners living in cold shacks in companytowns, and steel towns that were armed camps.  I saw men black-listed, driven fromtown to town, forced to change their names because they had dared to try to organize aunion. We will prove to you that it is not the Communists who haveadvocated or practiced force and violence but that it is the employing class which hasdone both throughout the history of my life in the American labor movement, like GeneralSherman Bell who said in Colorado during a miner’s strike “To Hell with habeascorpus; we’ll give them post-mortems.” We will prove to you that -- *           *           *           *           *           *           * -- We will prove to you that it is nor we who flauntthe Constitution and the Bill of Rights, but that is has always been done by the employingclass.  We will prove that we are fighting here for our constitutional and democraticrights, not to advocate force and violence, but to expose and stop its use against thepeople. We will demonstrate that in fighting for our rights, we believe weare defending the constitutional rights of all Americans. We believe we are acting as goodAmericans. Since six out of eleven of my writings in Political Affairs listedby the Government deal with what is called defense, I will prove to you that this has beena part of my life work since 1907 before there was a Communist Party. For example, I distributed thousands of copies of a famous documentin the ‘20’s called “Illegal Practices of the Department of Justice,”which is not among the Government’s exhibits of old-time documents, but which I wouldgladly offer to the jury. It was signed by twelve of the most prominent lawyers ofthat period, including Professors Frankfurter and Chafee of Harvard and Francis FisherKane, who resigned his post as United States Attorney in Philadelphia in protest againstsuch proceedings. I early engaged in struggles to win free speech on the streets andin halls. This early identification with civil liberties led to my becoming a chartermember of the American Civil liberties Union in 1917, and later the organizer of theWorkers Defense Union, a delegate body from unions and fraternal organizations whichfurnished legal defense in political and labor prosecutions. We had plenty to do during the infamous 1920 Palmer Red Raids. We defended Socialist: I defended Socialists -- *           *           *           *           *           *           * -- I worked for seven years in the unsuccessfulstruggles to save the lives of Sacco and Vanzetti. In the Government’s list ofexhibits is an article I wrote in August, 1947 entitled “Sacco and Vanzetti -- TwentyYears After,” in which I pointed out the worldwide belief in their innocence. *           *           *           *           *           *           * Now I will show how and why I left the I.W.W. andjoined the Communist Party.  This bears directly on the issue of forcible overthrowof the government that Mr. Lane spoke to you about this morning.  After carefulreflection, it became clear to me that the I.W.W. was an anarcho-syndicalistorganization.  The I.W.W. wanted to bring Socialism within Capitalism and then breakthrough the shell of Capitalism by the general strike and the seizing and possession ofindustry. Now, it was precisely this position that I rejected. I came to the conclusion that Socialism could be achieved, not byone splurge of violence, but by the persistent political activities of the workers and thepeople.  And so in order to participate in political activities in the effort toachieve Socialism, I joined the Communist Party.  In doing this, I got back into thelabor movement and stopped being what I then had decided was anarchistic. *           *           *           *           *           *           * As to the origin of the Communist Party, we willshow here that there developed within the Socialist Party an organized Left-wing movementuntil, by 1919, it was the majority of that party. At the Chicago convention of the Socialist Party a splitoccurred.  The Left wing, ejected by the police, reorganized as the CommunistParty.  The Left wing was the majority of the old Socialist Party. All of my Socialist friends and associates were Left-wingers. I was in great sympathy with them. By 1926, I had become convinced that the Communist Party was thelogical inheritor of all the best traditions, history and struggles of the older Socialistmovement and of the I.W.W., too.  I was ready to join the party and gave anapplication to Charles Ruthenberg, then the secretary of the Communist Party, in 1926. Due to his sudden death a few weeks later during the most criticalperiod of my own illness, that application was apparently lost.  Anyhow, it was neverpresented to the Party.  I was ill of heart trouble in Portland, Oregon, at thattime. While there, I was in constant touch with my old friends, Ella ReeveBloor and Anita Whitney of California, both Communist leaders. Naturally, my heart and mind, although I was ill, were deeplyinvolved in the current political problems of the people, the menace of Fascism in Europe,the great struggles of the unemployment led by Communists Foster, Amter, Minor, Dennis andothers, and later the new unions which were present during the New Deal of PresidentRoosevelt. Miss Whitney brought me a Daily Worker in the fall of 1935 with aspeech by George Dimitroff, called “The United Front Against War and Fascism,”which the Government has stated it intends offering in evidence.  This speech made adeep impression on me. We will show the character of Communist work in the struggle againstfascism in answer to this clarion call of Dimitroff, who died in 1949 as premier of hiscountry.  We will show the background of this speech, which is essential in order foryou to understand its meaning and the intent with which I then joined the Communist Party. This was the time of the rise of fascism, which we will show seemedvery remote to most people in our country in the ‘30’s. People laughed at Hitlerand Mussolini as demagogues and mountebanks, but it caused great concern to the peoples ofEurope, especially to the Communists in those countries directly affected or threatened. George Dimitroff was a Bulgarian Communist who had been in exile inGermany and while there was framed in the infamous Reichstag fire case. *           *           *           *           *           *           * Dimitroff was freed.  He took refuge in theSoviet Union, where he delivered this speech in 1935 at the Congress of the CommunistInternational.  It is an eloquent and dramatic appeal to fight fascism, which hedescribes as the most vicious enemy of mankind.  It is addressed to Communistsespecially and other progressive people elsewhere, to put aside all immediate partisan orsectarian interest or differences or ultimate political aims to unite to stopfascism.  We will prove that this is what is meant by “united front.” This policy brought Communists together with all other honest and patriotic people whowere determined to save their country from the ravages of fascism.  We will show thatHank Forbes, one of our party organizers who might otherwise be here as a defendant, losthis life at the Anzio Beachhead in pursuance of that policy, as did hundreds of AmericanCommunists in World War II. I resolved when I read this powerful appeal, “Here is where Ibelong.  As soon as I am well I will again apply to join the CommunistParty.”  I did so.  William Z. Foster, whom I first met in 1909 in theI.W.W., and Ella Reeve Bloor, whom I knew from the old Socialist Party, presented myapplication in the winter of 1936 and 1937. It was accepted and publicly announced in thepress. In my extreme youth I had affiliated myself with the nonpoliticalI.W.W.; in my maturity I came back into the working class political movement ofsocialism.  This may seem a very lengthy introduction, but I have tried to drawconclusions from my biography on the issues in this case.  I did not intend it to bepersonal, but and explanation of how and why I became a Communist.  And I am anexample, not and exception. Now, as to my official position in the Communist Party, which Igladly and proudly acknowledge -- they are a matter of public record: in 1938 I became andam today a member of the National Committee of the Communist Party.  The NationalCommittee was reduced in 1948 to 13.  The other 12 members are William Z. Foster, ourchairman, who has been seriously ill for several years, and my dear comrades, the 11Communist leaders convicted under the Smith Act, which they challenged asunconstitutional.  I have also been chairman of the Women’s Committee of theCommunist Party since 1945, which the evidence will show carries on struggle for equalrights for women in shops, unions, and all organizations, even including our own partywhen necessary. My comrade, Claudia Jones, a defendant here, is the executivesecretary.  We have worked together, spoken together, written, and helped organizewomen for full equality, both politically and economically, for the building of movementsfor peace, consumers’ councils, parent-teachers’ organizations, and similarorganizations, for the unity of Negro and white women, and to overcome the exploitation ofNegro women as workers, as women, as Negroes. Many articles which both of us have written on these subjects arefeatured in the Government’s list of exhibits.  We will demonstrate to you howconstructive and beneficial is the nature of our work among women, inspiring them togreater self-confidence, greater comradeship with one another, greater participation inpublic affairs.  The evidence will show further that we have urged the organizationof women for political activity, not only on Election Day, but the year around, inhearings, delegations, petitions and statements to all legislative and public bodies onsuch issues as child care, better schools, better housing, a better standard of living,etc. We have written of the history of the women’s movement in ourcountry, where every right we now enjoy has been won only by organized struggle -- theright of women to vote, to serve on juries, protective labor legislation for womenworkers, mothers’ pensions, and so forth. We have directed our sharpest criticism to the virtualdisfranchisement of the southern Negro women by force and violence and through the pooltax, discrimination against women in factories, lack of upbringing, etc. We have advocated socialism as a system of society best guaranteeingto women full equal rights in all spheres and insuring to them the possibility ofexercising these rights. I remind you again that we are not asking you to agree with us, butwill prove to you that we have not been advocating force and violence, but, rather, apeaceful, happy world. I have also been chairman of the defense committee of the Partysince 1948, when our leaders previously referred to were arrested.  The evidence willshow that our duties, my duties, were to raise funds necessary for adequate legal defenseof our members who might be arrested under the Smith Act or held for deportation under theMcCarran Act.  Individual Communists are not financially able to defendthemselves.  These duties are ours.  Our duties were to publicize the facts inthe case, since newspaper coverage is notoriously inadequate and invariably prejudiced, toorganized mass meetings, arrange tours for speakers, and generally call for public supportfor their defense. *           *           *           *           *           *           * In addition, the Government’s list ofdocuments which they told us they would introduce in this case or indicated they wouldintroduce in this case, makes clear to you, will make clear to you, that I am a columnistof the Daily Worker.  This is correct.  For 15 years, form 1937 to date, I haveproduced at least two columns a week, besides many feature articles for the Sundaypaper.  The Worker.  These are my personal columns and are not submitted to theeditorial staff in advance.  Praise or criticism comes from the readers.  Someof my columns and articles are listed by the Government as Government’s exhibits,which they intend to introduce. If they are to prove my official position in our Party ormy tours around the country or that I spoke in any specific places or that I invitedpeople to join the Communist Party, the Government need not waste its time.  I do notdeny any of these things.  The evidence will show that I asked people to joinit.  I believe in the Party to which I belong.  It is a legal Party in myestimation devoted to the best interest of the people, and I would not belong to it if Iwould hesitate to ask any honest persons to join me.  Hundreds did so at myinvitation.  I would be glad to make available to the jury at the appropriate timenot just a few articles carefully culled for the Government’s purposes, but all ofthem dealing with a vast range of subjects. I will prove to you thereby that there is no advocacy of force andviolence in any one of them. *           *           *           *           *           *           * I have also written a dozen pamphlets during thepast period covered by the indictment. *           *           *           *           *           *           * One is called Stool Pigeon.  Another The Plot to Gag America. The Government did not list them for your attention.  Irecommend especially that you do read one of their listed documents if and when it ispresented -- the eloquent and able opening remarks of Eugene Dennis, General Secretary ofthe Communist Party, when he stood here, as I am standing now, defending himself beforeanother jury.  I wrote an introduction to it.  It is called The Case for theCommunist Party.  The Government has indicated that it intends offering it inevidence, possibly for this reason.  I am glad that the Government will make itavailable to you and would be happy to follow congressional example and ask that thisspeech of Eugene Dennis be considered an extension of my remarks. *           *           *           *           *           *           * I have handbills, advertisements and pressclipping relative to hundreds of public mass meetings arranged by the Communist Party atwhich I and other defendants have spoken in the past 15 years.  We will prove thatnowhere has there been any advocacy of force and violence.  The subject matter ofsuch meetings should interest this jury, I believe, however, as evidence of our intent. Take some at random:  ""The Struggle Against the Taft-Hartley Law"" -- ""The Rights of the Negro People"" -- *           *           *           *           *           *           * I and other defendants have spokenduring the period covered by the indictment and previously on the radio, especially inpolitical campaigns in support of Communist and other candidates, including Councilmen Cacchione and Davis, and for Simon W. Gerson, a defendant present here, when he was acandidate after Mr. Cacchione’s sudden death. We will prove to you that the Communist Party, U.S.A.,is not, as the indictment sets forth, a society, group or assembly of persons but is alegitimate political party.  It has nominated candidates for all public offices,including that of President. We will prove that defendants here on trial have beencandidates and won substantially high votes -- Perry, Gerson, Begun, Johnson, Weinstone andWeinstock. I ran with Mr. Benjamin J. Davis for Congress-at-largein 1942 and we each received over 50,000 votes. Our campaign slogan or program for victory was: “Not an idle man. Not an idle machine. Not an idle acre.” Mr. Gerson received 150,000 votes in Brooklyn in 1948. One of the defendants in the current Los Angeles Smith Act trial, aknown Communist, Miss Bernadette Doyle, received over 600,000 votes for a state-wideoffice as a peace candidate. Our evidence will prove how the Communist Party operatespolitically.  We are a party of a new type in that we are not before the people justto capture their votes.  We will prove that we are politically active the year round.We have attended public hearings as Communist spokesmen: for instance, I appeared with Mr.Gerson before the Senate Judiciary Committee to oppose the appointment of Tom Clarke tothe Supreme Court. If our Party along with other minority parties were not hampered byever-increasing electoral restrictions and barred from the ballot in some states, webelieve firmly we would win many more votes and elect candidates to Congress. Communists are represented in the Parliaments of all majornon-fascist countries in the world today. This is the arena where political views belong, in the marketplaceof public discussion, to be passed upon solely by the electorate of our country. The Government obviously intends to make much of the fact thatoccasionally we spoke in somebody’s home to a selected group of people.  Inreference to such house gatherings -- and some were purely social -- we will show that theseare some of the reasons: Sometimes it was because no hall could be rented and in smallone-industry towns, like steel, coal and textiles, people seen at a Communist meeting bycompany spies would lose their jobs and be black-listed, and even the unions would not beable to protect these members. Sometimes we held them in homes for the convenience of women whocould not attend otherwise.  Sometimes it was for the protection of Negro people,especially in the South and border state areas, that the speaker goes to them rather thanexpecting them to come to the speaker.  We will show that we consider it our duty asCommunists to protect workers, members and non-members alike, from harassment, loss ofjobs, threats of violence or FBI surveillance, and just because they come to ourmeetings.  Wherever possible our meetings were open with the public and the pressinvited.  Sometimes, unfortunately, Communists are driven to privacy as protectionagainst persecution. Criticism should not be directed to us but at those who create therepressive conditions which, we will prove, forces workers to choose between their jobsand their beliefs.  We will prove, and I can assure you, that no member of our partybut what would be happy and willing to publicly declare his or her membership if the samerights and protection were accorded to us as to all others engaged in political activityin our country. The Government will also make much of schools, as Mr. Lane hasalready indicated, where Marxism-Leninism was taught. I gave lectures at certain schools in New York City, Pittsburgh,Philadelphia, Cleveland and at a national training school.  My topics were either“History of the Labor Movement” or “History of the Women’s Movement inthe U.S.A.”  I have the outlines which I used in these courses which areanalytical and explanatory, and I will, because they are only brief -- I will offer them inevidence in this case. A course on the “History of the American Labor Movement,”delivered at the Jefferson School of New York, is presented here as the overt act of Mr.Louis Weinstock. This brings us to the skeleton upon which this case is built -- astrange new type of overt act, suggestive, if I may say so, of Nazi book-burning. They set forth -- *           *           *           *           *           *           * They set forth, we believe, activities which arethe ordinary everyday acts of all organizations and individuals who seek to present theirviews in the marketplace of ideas. Of 29 overt acts, 11 are articles in the magazine Political Affairs. 5 are Daily Worker articles. 5, including mine, are public meetings. 2 are committee meetings. 2 are classes. One is leaving a building. One is mailing letters. One is writing a pamphlet. One is becoming a party organizer. The Government will attempt to clothe them, too.  I presume, inthe so-called Aesopian language, or, no matter what we said, we really meant its opposite.It is quite a Houdini-like performance to say peace to a mass meeting of 10,000 people andmean war. Mr. Perry and I and our co-defendants will try, in the evidence wesubmit as this case progresses, to cut through the maze of what we considermisrepresentations in relation to Aesopian language, and to make it clear that what -- thatwe say what we mean and we mean what we say, and that the language of Marxism-Leninism isnot as mysterious or obscure as the Government attempts to make it sound. All sciences, even the law, have their own terminology, but like adoctor’s prescription, this does not mean they are dishonest or misleading to thegeneral public.  Not a single act of violence is alleged against any one of us. Not are there charges that I know of thus far that any of us collectively or individuallyadvocated the forceful overthrow of the United States Government. This science of Marxism-Leninism, which is expounded in the books asevidence had its origin over a century ago with two great political thinkers, Karl Marxand Frederick Engels.  In a few words -- and there is always a danger ofover -- simplification of a scientific subject, they declared that what happens to humanityis not a matter of blind fate nor the will of great men, nor must it be accepted asirrevocable.  They said mankind can find a scientific explanation for wars, famine,economic depression and poverty, and that mankind, especially the working class, can helpto change society, can alter and direct the course of history, can abolish these evils andinstitute a planned social order, based on the well-being of all. Out of their profoundanalysis of all human history, and especially of its present stage known as capitalism,they developed the system of scientific socialism which you will hear clarified by ourwitnesses. Today it has become a tremendous subject, too vast for any oneperson to fully explain, nor would the time allowed for a trial permit it.  TheGovernment, I believe, will try to do the impossible, to compress over a century of thedevelopment of a great social science into the use of a few books and an infinitesimalpart of its application. These scientific theories were not fixed and final at the death ofMarx and Engels who never considered them a dogma.  Like all sciences, they haveexpanded and have been modified by subsequent developments. Other students and writers took up where they left off, particularlyV. I. Lenin, a giant intellect and a great man who suffered exile and imprisonment underthe Russian Czar. He returned to his beloved country to lead the workers and peasantsto free themselves form Czarist tyranny and exploitation. Lenin enriched Marxism by hisstudies, especially his analyses of new social conditions brought about by the rise ofimperialism and the advent of socialism. Marxist-Leninist writings today fill thousands of books in all knownlanguages and would more than fill this courtroom from floor to ceiling.  They arestudied by millions of people throughout the world, but we will prove to you that thesegreat beacon lights are not blueprints, are not hard-and-fast directives but are only aguide, modified to conform to the developments of history and to new socialconditions.  Programs, immediate programs are their application. We hold that political theories are not triable in a court of lawunder our established American tradition.  No jury’s verdict can decide theirmerit; only the people can do that. We have believed that under the Bill of Rights wehave a right to advocate our views, but since our ideas are here on trial we feel we havea sacred duty to ourselves and to our Party to adequately defend them from any slander ordistortion. We contend that Americans have a right to speak their minds out onany subject. We Communists have a right to defend socialism or the evolution of thecapitalist system and economy and of the private ownership of the means of life of all thepeople. We will prove that such a change can and will be achieved, only whenthe majority of the American people are ready and willing to make it, and that theCommunist Party does not advocate force and violence to effect such a change. We will try to prove to you during this trial the meaning of workingclass internationalism, which the Government will use to bolster up their theory offoreign agent. Abraham Lincoln said:  “The strongest bond of humansympathy, outside the family relation, should be one uniting all working people of allnations and tongues, and kindred.” Both May Day and International Women’s Day,we will prove, had their origin here in the United States even though they are nowcelebrated internationally. In the spirit of such solidarity I will show that I made three tripsabroad and which, except for visits to Canada, were my first outside the U.S.A.  Theoccasions were a Congress of Women, held in 1945; the 80th birthday of Marcel Cachin,editor of the Communist daily paper of Paris, L’Humanite, in 1949: and to cover theconvention of the French Communist Party in 1950, where I was received as a fraternaldelegate from our American party and invited to deliver its greetings. On this last trip I visited London over a weekend, spoke at a LondonDistrict Communist Party conference, and visited the grave of Karl Marx. You will undoubtedly hear evidence form the Government of my firsttrip to Europe. The International Congress of Women was held in 1945, before the ashes ofwar were cold. Women participated from all the Allied countries:  The Soviet Union,England, France, Italy, Hungary and others. Many had just been released form concentration camps andprisons:  Ravensbrouck, Buchenwald, Auschwitz.  We met women there who had beenin the Soviet Army air force, who had been in charge of railroads, were executives ofindustry and reconstruction; women who came from a socialist country. We met Spanish womenin exile, some who came out of Spain at the risk of their lives. This Congress held in Paris, without heat, with flickering lights,with sparse food supplies, was dedicated to the establishment of permanent peace in theworld, the welfare of children, to the rights of women, all so ruthlessly destroyed by theNazis.  “Never to let it happen again” was their burning resolve. Our American delegation was amazed that they were so fearful thatfascism, like the fabled Phoenix, would arise again from its own ashes. On our home voyagevia an Army transport carrying over 5,000 returning G.I.’s, we found their desire forpeace as eager as that of the European women. We will prove here that our work on behalfof peace is identical with the hopes and dreams of men and women all over the world aswell as the whole American people today. I wrote a series of 28 articles on these trips.  The one theGovernment has listed is “I Met A Great Leader of France,” published February 3,1946, in The Worker and referring to a member and vice-president of the French Assembly, aleader of the French resistance movement against the Nazis, a French Communist leader,Jacques Duclos.  You have heard his name from Mr. Lane.  You will hear a greatdeal about this French Communist who had written an article in a French Communistsmagazine Cahiers Du Communisme, in April, 1945.  It was addressed to his Frenchcomrades. We will prove that they had reconstructed their party officially on itsemergence from underground and were determined not to lose its identity in the popularUnited Front which had developed in the days of the resistance.  While cooperating tothe fullest for the reestablishment of the French Republic, they maintained theirindependent existence as the Communist Party of France.  We will prove that he usedas an example of the wrong way to work, the dissolution of the American Communist Partyand the creation of the Communist Political Association, which he analyzed in detail forthe clarification of his French readers to counteract “certain suggestions forliquidation,” which had been circulated there in France.  But we will prove thathis article, while it was a sharp criticism of the American party, was not a directive noran order.  It stands to reason that such a characterization of our course asnotorious revisionism which came from an heroic fighter against Nazism, and a Communist ofworld renown, caused us to give it our most serious attention; especially was this so, andwe will prove, when it coincided with alarming developments within our own country whichconvinced us that the capitalist leopard had not changed its spots during the war, but wasready to resume class hostilities against American labor unions and our Party. We will prove to you that a revaluation of our thinking and actionshad already begun in our party leadership, and even without the Duclon article, althoughpossibly not quite so swiftly, we would have reconstituted our Party, which had existedsince 1919, interrupted only by an extremely short period of the few months of theCommunist Political Association. We feel that we have a right to call upon the Government to explainin the course of their accusations why, if the alleged danger emanating from our work wasso clear and present that the Smith Act was needed in 1940, why wasn’t it usedagainst our leadership until 1948, or against us, the present defendants, until elevenyears after the passage?  We will prove that Socialism was not on the agenda of the1940 American political campaign, nor in 1944, nor 1948, or even now in 1952, and,therefore, cannot be the real causative factor for this indictment. We have publicly advocated Socialism as our ultimate goal since thebirth of our Party 33 years ago, please remember. Nor is the charge of force and violence a newly discoveredissue.  It was fought out tenaciously by the Government for 16 years in the famousSchneiderman case, which began in 1927, and which they lost before the Supreme Court in1943 -- *           *           *           *           *           *           * -- three years after the Smith Act was passed. It was an attempt to cancel the citizenship of a leading Communist. If our Party needed reassurance of its legal rights, we felt it wascertainly given by this decision.  Justice Murphy wrote the opinion.  I willquote to you a portion of it, which to out Party and to the country generally wasunderstood to have laid low this false accusation of force and violence once and for all,and to have reaffirmed our right to advocate our political views. This also casts light onour intent, which you must consider.  The Supreme Court had before them four of thebooks produced here -- the quote is as follows: A tenable conclusion from the foregoing is that the Party in1927 desired to achieve its purpose by peaceful and democratic means, and as a theoreticalmatter justified the use of force and violence only as a method of preventing an attemptedforcible counter-overthrow once the Party had obtained control in a peaceful manner, or asa method of last resort to enforce the majority will if at some indefinite future timebecause of peculiar circumstances constitutional or peaceful channels were no longeropen. That is the close of Justice Murphy’s quote.  We willprove that our Party has repeatedly endorsed this statement as a basically correct, thoughincomplete, statement of our Party’s policy in the matter of force and violence, andWilliam Z. Foster, our chairman, so stated a few years ago before the Senate JudiciaryCommittee. It is our contention that neither of these issues, neither Socialismnor the charge of force and violence, should rightfully bring us before this jury on thisindictment.  They becloud the real issues which we believe are to be found primarilyin our day-to-day activities which are not peripheral or fringe activities as theGovernment contends, but the heart of our work.  To fight against fascist tendenciesin our country and to fight for peace is to us Marxism and Leninism in action. We believe that the struggle for peace and democratic rights willvery soon lead to a new political alignment in our country, which we believe will breakthrough the pattern of the two-party system and establish a new people’s party, acoalition which we would support. We will prove that what is called capitalism has existed only acomparatively short time in the United States, less than two centuries, and it is notidentical with government.  It is neither the first nor the last stage of humansociety.  Only those who profit by it consider it the Alpha and Omega, the best ofall possible conclusions. Before capitalism there was feudalism, when the feudal lords ownedthe land and lived on the labor of their serf. Before that there were chattel slavery, barbarism. Capitalism developed and supplanted feudalism.  With the adventof power-operated mass production machinery, it expanded rapidly, controlled by anever-smaller group as free competition was replaced by monopoly. When we speak of abolishing capitalism, we do not mean of course toabolish the rich natural resources of our country, nor the vast productive industrieswhich have been developed by the labor of its people.  We will prove that we meanabolishing the private ownership of the basic means of production and the profit-makingsystem it engenders, which permits a few, the capitalistic class, to exploit the many. We mean that the natural resources, and the mines, mills, factories,railroads, means of communication, shall be owned in common by all the people as stateproperty to be administered by a government representing the working class, as well as allother people. We don’t mean that personal or private property is abolished inthose things which are the result of saving or for personal use. What will be abolished isthe use of private property to exploit the labor of another.  For example, in asocialistic society the principle applied would be from each according to his ability toeach according to this work, which is identical with what St. Paul said to theThessalonians, that if any would not work, neither should he eat. In a Communist society, as differentiated from a socialisticsociety, when an abundance of everything needed for human life, development and comfort isassured, the principle would then be from each according to his ability, to each accordingto his needs. This will be Communism, the fulfillment, we believe, of an idealhuman society, which we believe to be possible and desirable. In answer as to how we expect socialism will be brought about, incontradiction to the theory of force and violence, we will prove, as I have said, itcannot be the result of our efforts alone but it can be the result of the action of themajority of the people of the United States when they are ready and willing to make such achange. We will show that we sincerely denounce in our constitution“any group or party which conspires or acts to subvert, undermine, weaken oroverthrow any or all institutions of American democracy through which the majority of theAmerican people can maintain their rights to determine their destinies.” In relation to a future hypothetical situation in the United Stateswhere an entrenched capitalist minority might use force to thwart the will of the peoplewho voted for and are ready to make the transition to socialism, this would be tyranny,and we would take the position that the people would be justified to use force tooverthrow it, just like our own Government called upon the people of Nazi Germany andfascist Italy to overthrow the rule of terror against the people and aid the undergroundresistance movement in all fascist-occupied countries. The Communist position is thatthose who favored slavocracy opposed the abolition of human slavery in the past; it isquite possible that a diehard capitalist minority might oppose the abolition of thecapitalist profit system in the future. Here, as in England and elsewhere, weCommunist strive for a peaceful road to Socialism. We will show that we would doeverything in our power to prevent the use of force and violence in establishingSocialism, which we know full well cannot be undertaken here or elsewhere unless it hasthe support of the majority of the people.  But we cannot, of course, guarantee thatthe enemies of the people will accept the decision of the people to move to Socialism.Socialism, however, is not yet on the order of the day, let me repeat, in the UnitedStates.  The immediate political program of our Party, we will prove, is anti-war andanti-fascist, for a people’s front government, a government dedicated to assure thewell-being of the people.  What will take place after that along the road toSocialism in the United States of America is something history and the American peoplewill determine, but which no one can here blueprint.  This brings me now to myconcluding remarks. We are here before you as defendants in the Smith Act case.  Wewill prove to you that we are not conspirators, but that we are animated and united bycommon ideals and aspirations, with courage to affirm our beliefs, faith in the people andthe future, and a willingness to sacrifice for a better world, which we are confident isin birth.  Nevertheless, it is incumbent on the Government, regardless of ourideological unity, to deal with us as individuals, and not to lump us together as aconspiracy because of the identity of our political views.  We will try to bring youa true and accurate picture of who we are, what our lives have been, what we say and mean,what we live by day by day and the relation of all this immediate activity to our ultimateaims. We will try to present to you during this trial our theories and work, ourprogram, and our ultimate goal, the unity of theory and practice as it says in thebooks.  We will not do this in a classroom atmosphere, but so that you can understandus, in terms of our own knowledge and experience, regardless of whether you agree withus.  We expect to convince you that we are within our established constitutionalrights to advocate change and progress, to advocate Socialism, which we are convinced willguarantee to all our people in our great and beautiful country the rights of life,liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Whether we are right is no issue here, and nojury, in this or any other trial, but time alone, will decide.  Let none of usforget, especially in this trial in dealing with new ideas and proposals for socialchange, the wise words of Abraham Lincoln: “This country with its institutions belongs to the people whoinhabit it.” We are asking you to decide this case on the evidence, or, morecorrectly, may I say, on the lack of evidence which we are confident will be glaringlyrevealed long before this trial is over, to decide this case on the exact issues,regardless of fear or favor or the hysteria or prejudice which we all know very well doesexist among some groups in the community.  We ask you to keep your minds open untilall the evidence, including our own, is before you.  Then you will be shown that wedo not advocate the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force andviolence.  "
For the Equal Rights Amendment Aug 10 1970,Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm,1970,"Mr. Speaker, House Joint Resolution 264, before us today, whichprovides for equality under the law for both men and women, represents one of the mostclear-cut opportunities we are likely to have to declare our faith in the principles thatshaped our Constitution. It provides a legal basis for attack on the most subtle, mostpervasive, and most institutionalized form of prejudice that exists.  Discriminationagainst women, solely on the basis of their sex, is so widespread that is seems to manypersons normal, natural and right. Legal expression of prejudice on the grounds of religious orpolitical belief has become a minor problem in our society. Prejudice on the basis of raceis, at least, under systematic attack. There is reason for optimism that it will start todie with the present, older generation. It is time we act to assure full equality ofopportunity to those citizens who, although in a majority, suffer the restrictions thatare commonly imposed on minorities, to women. The argument that this amendment will not solve the problem of sexdiscrimination is not relevant. If the argument were used against a civil rights bill -- asit has been used in the past -- the prejudice that lies behind it would be embarrassing. Ofcourse laws will not eliminate prejudice from the hearts of human beings. But that is noreason to allow prejudice to continue to be enshrined in our laws -- to perpetuateinjustice through inaction. The amendment is necessary to clarify countless ambiguities andinconsistencies in our legal system. For instance, the Constitution guarantees due processof law, in the 5th and 14th amendments. But the applicability of due process of sexdistinctions is not clear: Women are excluded from some State colleges and universities.In some States, restrictions are placed on a married woman who engages in an independentbusiness. Women may not be chosen for some juries. Women even receive heavier criminalpenalties than men who commit the same crime. What would the legal effects of the equalrights amendment really be? The equal rights amendment would govern only the relationshipbetween the State and its citizens -- not relationships between private citizens. Theamendment would be largely self-executing, that is, and Federal or State laws in conflictwould be ineffective one year after date of ratification without further action by theCongress or State legislatures. Opponents of the amendment claim its ratification would throw thelaw into a state of confusion and would result in much litigation to establish itsmeaning. This objection overlooks the influence of legislative history in determiningintent and the recent activities of many groups preparing for legislative changes in thisdirection. State labor laws applying only to women, such as those limitinghours of work and weights to be lifted would become inoperative unless the legislatureamended them to apply to men. As of early 1970, most States would have some laws that would be affected. However, changes are being made so rapidly as a result of Title VII ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, it is likely that by the time the Equal Rights Amendmentwould become effective, no conflicting State laws would remain. In any event, there has for years been great controversy as to theusefulness to women of these State labor laws. There has never been any doubt that theyworked a hardship on women who need or want to work overtime and on women who need or wantbetter paying jobs; and there has been no persuasive evidence as to how many women benefitfrom the archaic policy of the laws. After the Delaware hours law was repealed in 1966,there were no complaints from women to any of the State agencies that might have beenapproached. Jury service laws not making women equally liable for jury servicewould have been revised. The selective service law would have to include women, but womenwould not be required to serve in the Armed Forces where they are not fitted any more thanmen are required to serve. Military service, while a great responsibility, is not withoutbenefits, particularly for young men with limited education or training. Since October 1966, 246,000 young men who did not meet the normalmental or physical requirements have been given opportunities for training and correctingphysical problems. This opportunity is not open to their sisters. Only girls who havecompleted high school and meet high standards on the educational test can volunteer.Ratification of the amendment would not permit application of higher standards to women. Survivorship benefits would be available to husbands of femaleworkers on the same basis as to wives of male workers. The Social Security Act and thecivil service and military service retirement acts are in conflict. Public schools anduniversities could not be limited to one sex and could not apply different admissionstandards to men and women. Laws requiring longer prison sentences for women than menwould be invalid, and equal opportunities for rehabilitation and vocational training wouldhave to be provided in public correctional institutions. Different ages of majority basedon sex would have to be harmonized. Federal, State, and other governmental bodies would beobligated to follow nondiscriminatory practices in all aspects of employment, includingpublic school teachers and State university and college faculties. What would be the economic effects of the Equal Rights Amendment? Directeconomic effects would be minor. If any labor laws applying only to women still remained,their amendment or repeal would provide opportunity for women in better-paying jobs inmanufacturing. More opportunities in public vocational and graduate schools for womenwould also tend to open up opportunities in better jobs for women. Indirect effects could be much greater. The focusing of publicattention on the gross legal, economic, and social discrimination against women byhearings and debates in the Federal and State legislatures would result in changes inattitude of parents, educators, and employers that would bring about substantial economicchanges in the long run. Sex prejudice cuts both ways. Men are oppressed by the requirementsof the Selective Service Act, by enforced legal guardianship of minors, and by alimonylaws. Each sex, I believe, should be liable when necessary to serve and defend thiscountry. Each has a responsibility for the support of children. There are objections raised to wiping out laws protecting womenworkers. No one would condone exploitation. But what does sex have to do with it. Workingconditions and hours that are harmful to women are harmful to men; wages that are unfairfor women are unfair for men. Laws setting employment limitations on the basis of sex areirrational, and the proof of this is their inconsistency from State to State. The physicalcharacteristics of men and women are not fixed, but cover two wide spans that have a greatdeal of overlap. It is obvious, I think, that a robust woman could be more fit forphysical labor than a weak man. The choice of occupation would be determined by individualcapabilities, and the rewards for equal works should be equal. This is what it comes down to: artificial distinctions betweenpersons must be wiped out of the law. Legal discrimination between the sexes is, in almostevery instance, founded on outmoded views of society and the pre-scientific beliefs aboutpsychology and physiology. It is time to sweep away these relics of the past and setfuture generations free of them. Federal agencies and institutions responsible for the enforcement ofequal opportunity laws need the authority of a Constitutional amendment. The 1964 CivilRights Act and the 1963 Equal Pay Act are not enough; they are limited in theircoverage -- for instance, one excludes teachers, and the other leaves out administrative andprofessional women. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has not proven to be anadequate device, with its power limited to investigation, conciliation, and recommendationto the Justice Department. In its cases involving sexual discrimination, it has failed inmore than one-half. The Justice Department has been even less effective. It hasintervened in only one case involving discrimination on the basis of sex, and this was ona procedural point. In a second case, in which both sexual and racial discrimination werealleged, the racial bias charge was given far greater weight. Evidence of discrimination on the basis of sex should hardly have tobe cited here. It is in the Labor Department’s employment and salary figures foranyone who is still in doubt. Its elimination will involve so many changes in our Stateand Federal laws that, without the authority and impetus of this proposed amendment, itwill perhaps take another 194 years. We cannot be parties to continuing a delay. The timeis clearly now to put this House on record for the fullest expression of that equality ofopportunity which our Founding Fathers professed. They professed it, but they did notassure it to their daughters, as they tried to do for their sons. The Constitution they wrote was designed to protect the rights ofwhite, male citizens. As there were no black Founding Fathers, there were no foundingmothers -- a great pity, on both counts. It is not too late to complete the work theyleft undone. Today, here, we should start to do so. In closing, I would like to make one point: Social and psychologicaleffects will be initially more important than legal or economic results. As Leo Kanowitzhas pointed out: Rules of law that treat of the sexes per se [inevitably] produce far-reaching effects upon social, psychological and economic aspectsof male-female relations beyond the limited confines of legislative chambers andcourtrooms. As long as organized legal systems, at once the most respected and mostfeared of social institutions, continue to differentiate sharply, in treatment or inwords, between men and women on the basis of irrelevant and artificially createddistinctions, the likelihood of men and women coming to regard one another primarily asfellow human beings and only secondarily as representatives of another sex will continueto be remote. When men and women are prevented from recognizing oneanother’s essential humanity by sexual prejudices, nourished by legal as well as socialinstitutions, society as a whole remains less than it could otherwise become.  "
 On the Adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,Eleanor Roosevelt,1948,"Mr. President, fellow delegates: The long and meticulous study and debate of which this UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights is the product means that it reflects the composite views ofthe many men and governments who have contributed to its formulation. Not every man norevery government can have what he wants in a document of this kind. There are of courseparticular provisions in the Declaration before us with which we are not fully satisfied.I have no doubt this is true of other delegations, and it would still be true if we continued our labors over many years. Taken as a whole the Delegation ofthe United States believes that this is a good document -- even a great document -- and wepropose to give it our full support. The position of the United States on the variousparts of the Declaration is a matter of record in the Third Committee. I shall not burdenthe Assembly, and particularly my colleagues of the Third Committee, with a restatement ofthat position here. I should like to comment briefly on the amendments proposed by the Soviet delegation. The language of these amendments has been dressed up somewhat, but the substance is the same as the amendments which were offered by the Soviet delegation in committee and rejected after exhaustive discussion. Substantially the same amendments have been previously considered and rejected in the Human Rights Commission. We in the United States admire those who fight for their convictions, and the Soviet delegation has fought for their convictions. But in the older democracies we have learned that sometimes we bow to the will of the majority. In doing that, we do not give up our convictions. We continue sometimes to persuade, and eventually we may be successful. But we know that we have to work together and we have to progress. So, we believe that when we have made a good fight, and the majority is against us, it is perhaps better tactics to try to cooperate. I feel bound to say that I think perhaps it is somewhat of an imposition on this Assembly to have these amendments offered again here, and I am confident that they will be rejected without debate. The first two paragraphs of the amendment to article 3 deal with the question of minorities, which committee 3 decided required further study, and has recommended, in a separate resolution, their reference to the Economic and Social Council and the Human Rights Commission. As set out in the Soviet amendment, this provision clearly states ""group,"" and not ""individual,"" rights. The Soviet amendment to article 20 is obviously a very restrictive statement of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. It sets up standards which would enable any state practically to deny all freedom of opinion and expression without violating the article. It introduces the terms ""democratic view,"" ""democratic systems,"" ""democratic state,"" and ""fascism,"" which we know all too well from debates in this Assembly over the past two years on warmongering and related subjects are liable to the most flagrant abuse and diverse interpretations. The statement of the Soviet delegate here tonight is a very good case in point on this. The Soviet amendment of article 22 introduces new elements into the article without improving the committed text and again introduces specific reference to ""discrimination."" As was repeatedly pointed out in committee 3, the question of discrimination is comprehensively covered in article 2 of the Declaration, so that its restatement elsewhere is completely unnecessary and also has the effect of weakening the comprehensive principles stated in article 2. The new article proposed by the Soviet delegation is but a restatement of State obligation, which the Soviet delegation attempted to introduce into practically every article in the Declaration. It would convert the Declaration into a document stating obligations on states, thereby changing completely its character as a statement of principles to serve as a common standard of achievement for the members of the United Nations. The Soviet proposal for deferring consideration of the Declaration to the 4th session of the Assembly requires no comment. An identical text was rejected in committee 3 by a vote of 6 in favor and 26 against. We are all agreed, I am sure, that the Declaration, which has been worked on with such great effort and devotion, and over such a long period of time, must be approved by this Assembly at this session. Certain provisions of the Declaration are stated in such broad termsas to be acceptable only because of the provisions in article 30 providing for limitationon the exercise of the rights for the purpose of meeting the requirements of morality,public order, and the general welfare. An example of this is the provision that everyonehas the right to equal access to the public service in his country. The basic principle ofequality and of nondiscrimination as to public employment is sound, but it cannot beaccepted without limitation. My government, for example, would consider that this isunquestionably subject to limitation in the interest of public order and the generalwelfare. It would not consider that the exclusion from public employment of personsholding subversive political beliefs and not loyal to the basic principles and practicesof the constitution and laws of the country would in any way infringe upon this right. Likewise, my government has made it clear in the course of thedevelopment of the Declaration that it does not consider that the economic and social andcultural rights stated in the Declaration imply an obligation on governments to assure the enjoyment of these rights by direct governmental action. Thiswas made quite clear in the Human Rights Commission text of article 23 which served as aso-called ""umbrella"" article to the articles on economic and social rights. Weconsider that the principle has not been affected by the fact that this article no longercontains a reference to the articles which follow it. This in no way affects ourwhole-hearted support for the basic principles of economic, social, and cultural rightsset forth in these articles. In giving our approval to the Declaration today it is of primaryimportance that we keep clearly in mind the basic character of the document. It is not atreaty; it is not an international agreement. It is not and does not purport to be astatement of law or of legal obligation. It is a Declaration of basicprinciples of human rights and freedoms, to be stamped with the approval of the GeneralAssembly by formal vote of its members, and to serve as a common standard of achievementfor all peoples of all nations. We stand today at the threshold of a great event both in the life ofthe United Nations and in the life of mankind. This Universal Declaration of Human Rights may well become the international Magna Carta of all men everywhere. Wehope its proclamation by the General Assembly will be an event comparable to theproclamation of the Declaration of the Rights of Man by the French people in 1789, theadoption of the Bill of Rights by the people of the United States, and the adoption ofcomparable declarations at different times in other countries. At a time when there are so many issues on which we find itdifficult to reach a common basis of agreement, it is a significant fact that 58 stateshave found such a large measure of agreement in the complex field of human rights. Thismust be taken as testimony of our common aspiration first voiced in the Charter of theUnited Nations to lift men everywhere to a higher standard of life and to a greaterenjoyment of freedom. Man’s desire for peace lies behind this Declaration. Therealization that the flagrant violation of human rights by Nazi and Fascist countriessowed the seeds of the last world war has supplied the impetus for the work which bringsus to the moment of achievement here today. In a recent speech in Canada, Gladstone Murray said: The central fact is that man isfundamentally a moral being, that thelight we have is imperfect does not matter so long as we are alwaystrying to improve it … we are equal in sharing the moral freedomthatdistinguishes us as men. Man’s status makes each individual an endinhimself. No man is by nature simply the servant of the state or ofanother man … the ideal and fact of freedom -- and not technology -- are the true distinguishing marks of our civilization. This Declaration is based upon the spiritual fact that man must havefreedom in which to develop his full stature and through common effort to raise the levelof human dignity. We have much to do to fully achieve and to assure the rights set forthin this Declaration. But having them put before us with the moral backing of 58 nationswill be a great step forward. As we here bring to fruition our labors on this Declaration of HumanRights, we must at the same time rededicate ourselves to the unfinished task which liesbefore us. We can now move on with new courage and inspiration to the completion of aninternational covenant on human rights and of measures for the implementation of humanrights. In conclusion, I feel that I cannot do better than to repeat the callto action by Secretary Marshall in his opening statement to this Assembly: Let this third regular session of the General Assembly approve by anoverwhelming majority the Declaration of Human Rights as astandard of conduct for all; and let us, as Members of the UnitedNations, conscious of our own short-comings and imperfections, joinour effort in good faith to live up to this high standard.
